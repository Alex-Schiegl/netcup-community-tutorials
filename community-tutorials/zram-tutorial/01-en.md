# Introduction
Especially on systems with little RAM, it may happen from time to time that the available memory will become scarce and the system will start to use the swap memory. Since this is located on the hard drive, it is relatively slow compared to RAM and thus may impact the systems performance.

A remedy is provided by a technology integrated in the Linux kernel: zRam. This creates a compressing block device directly in the computer's RAM. The kernel first occupies the available RAM and then it tries to compress parts of it into zRam. It effectively only moves data within the RAM which is magnitudes faster than swapping to disk. This technique therefore allows more data to be accommodated in memory. Practically, this results in the system not having to swap to a slower hard disk as quickly. The price is a slightly increased processor load.

The installation is quite simple but can make a big impact on the performance of your server if memory is tight.

# Requirements
This tutorial should be adaptable to most Linux Distros as this is a kernel function. However the activation of the feature/the installation of the package may be different. I want to keep it related to Ubuntu and Debian here to keep it short and meaningful. So all you need is a vServer or Root Server from Netcup with Ubuntu or Debian installed and a user with root access.

# Step 1 - Installing zram-tools
```
sudo apt install zram-tools
```
# Step 2 - Adjust /etc/defaults/zramswap
Edit the configuration file with your favourite text editor e.g. `sudo vim /etc/defaults/zramswap`:
```
# EXAMPLE Configuration
# Adjust to your needs
#
# Specifies amount of zRam devices to create.
# By default, zRamswap-start will use all available cores.
CORES=4

# Specifies the amount of RAM that should be used for zRam
# based on a percentage the total amount of available memory
#PERCENTAGE=10

# Specifies a static amount of RAM that should be used for
# the zRam devices, this is in MiB
ALLOCATION=4096

# Specifies the priority for the swap devices, see swapon(2)
# for more details.
#PRIORITY=100
```
In this example configuration we do have a system with 4 cores which should all be used for the (de)compression. 

We can then tell zRam how much of our RAM should be used. This can either be a percentage of the total amount of available memory (PERCENTAGE) or a fixed value (ALLOCATION). In the example we decided to use a fixed amount of 4096 MiB of RAM. 

PRIORITY sets the priority for the swap device. You normally want to use zRam as the first swap device which is used, so we keep this at 100 (which is the highest priority). 

CORES and ALLOCATION now determine the number of block devices and their respective size (you will see what this means in a moment).

# Step 3 - Reboot
There are various methods to reboot your system. Here is one which works from your terminal:
```
sudo reboot
```

# Step 4 - Check your configuration
Now you should be able to see your zRam SWAP by typing `sudo swapon -s` which will show an output like this:
```
Filename                                Type            Size    Used    Priority
/swapfile                               file            4194300 0       -2
/dev/zram0                              partition       1048572 30472   100
/dev/zram1                              partition       1048572 30216   100
/dev/zram2                              partition       1048572 30652   100
/dev/zram3                              partition       1048572 30772   100
```
We see that we have a "standard" swap file `/swapfile` which is on our actual harddrive (this is the one we only want to use if we have no other option) and we have four zRam partitions `/dev/zram0` to `/dev/zram3` (which equals our configured cores) with the size of ALLOCATION / CORES (4096 MiB / 4). You can also see how much zRam is currently used as well as the priorities of the swap devices.

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully installed and configured zRam to make better use of your systems ressources. 

If you'd like to further tweak how your zRam is used you should take a look at the `/etc/sysctl.conf` where you can configure your swappiness, cache pressure etc.
```
# SYSCTL ZRAM EXAMPLE Configuration
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=500
vm.swappiness=100
vm.dirty_background_ratio=1
vm.dirty_ratio=50
```
This configuration would work good on systems with low memory. We start swapping early (as we do want to use our zRam as early as possible) and set a high cache pressure to keep memory consumption lower on the long term.

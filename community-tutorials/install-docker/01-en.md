# Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll have a look at how to setup docker on our freshly installed Ubuntu server. 
Docker is a great way to remove hardware dependency and isolate different services into containers. 
These containers can run on every system where docker can be installed and can also easily be moved between systems. 
At the end of this tutorial we will setup a small Minecraft server to showcase, what we can archive with docker.

# Requirements
- A server (root or VPS)
- Ubuntu as an operating system (debian would also work)

# Step 1 - Install docker

First we need to install required packages for docker:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```

Then we add the official docker GPG keys:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Next we add the required repository information:
```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Now we can finally install docker:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

After we ran all these commands, we verify that docker has been installed successfully:
```bash
docker --version
# Docker version 20.10.8, build 3967b7d
```

# Step 2 - Install docker-compose

The simplest way to use docker is via `docker-compose`. It allows to define files, that contain all the information we need, to run a docker container. 

First we download the `docker-compose` bin file:
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Then we apply the needed permissions:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Last but not least we verify the successful installation:
```bash
docker-compose --version
# docker-compose version v2.0.0, build 1110ad01
```

## Step 3 - First container

As a little example, we will setup a small minecraft server.

First we need to create the `docker-compose.yml` file for our server:
```
sudo nano docker-compose.yml
```

We insert the following content:
```yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  minecraft:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    container_name: Minecraft
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 25565:25565/udp
    volumes:
      - ./minecraft/:/data
    environment:
      - EULA: "true"
      - VERSION: LATEST
      - PATH: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

This sets the right image, ports, volumes and environment variables. 

Now we only need to start our server:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The first run may take a while, since the Minecraft server has to be setup. 
After that is done, we can connect to our new Minecraft server. 

To stop the server again, just use the following command:
```bash
docker-composer down
```

That's it, congratulations, you are now running a Minecraft server :tada:

# Conclusion

With docker it is rather easy to get services up and running within minutes. No need to deal with hardware specific configuration. Docker takes this pain away and allows to ease the administrators maintenance task. It also allows to separates different services into different containers, to keep it encapsulated in its own environment.

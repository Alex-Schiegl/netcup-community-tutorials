# Introduction
This tutorial will show you, how you can install a FTP server on a Debian Server and how you can secure the ftp connection (FTPs) <br>
For this, we will install ProFTPD <br>
I am doing this on a debian 11 server (Netcup RS 2000), but it also should work on other debian versions <br>
This is an advanced version of https://github.com/SanCraftDev/Debian-Setup/blob/main/README.md#proftpd

# Requirements
You need a Debian Server with an internet connection, which is accessible from the internet over a static IP on port 21.  <br>
You also need root permissions on your server.

# Step 1 - Installing ProFTPD
First, you need to connect to your server over ssh. <br>
Then we are going to switch to the root user and are updating the system, and then we install the ProFTPD Server
```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install wget curl sudo nano proftpd openssl -y
addgroup ftpuser
```

## Step 1.1 - Configuring ProFTPD
Open the ProFTPD configuration file
```sh
nano /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf
```

Press <kbd>CTRL + W</kbd> and enter `Group nogroup` to search the desired line. Now replace this line with `Group ftpuser`:
```diff
- Group nogroup
+ Group ftpuser
```

Press <kbd>CTRL + W</kbd> and enter `#Include /etc/proftpd/tls.conf` to search the desired line. Now replace this line with `Include /etc/proftpd/tls.conf`:
```diff
- #Include /etc/proftpd/tls.conf
+ Include /etc/proftpd/tls.conf
```

Now go to the end of the file and add there:
```
<Global>
  RequireValidShell  off
  RootLogin  off
  DefaultRoot ~
</Global>
 
<Limit LOGIN>
  DenyGroup  !ftpuser
</Limit>
```
Save your edit with <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>, then press <kbd>y</kbd> and now save it with <kbd>ENTER</kbd> <br>

## Setp 1.2 - Securing over SSL
To make the connection more secure we need to enable FTPs <br>
For this we first save the original FTPs Configuration, create an ssl certificate and create the new configuration.
```sh
cd /etc/proftpd/
mv tls.conf tls.conff
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:8096 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/proftpd.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/proftpd.crt -nodes -days 999999
```
Now you are asked some questions you can answer them or you answer with a Point (`.`) <br>

```sh
chmod 0640 /etc/ssl/private/proftpd.key
```
Now open the tls.conf:
```sh
nano tls.conf
```
An paste here:
```
<IfModule mod_tls.c>
TLSEngine                               on
TLSLog                                  /var/log/proftpd/tls.log
TLSProtocol                             SSLv123 TLSv1
TLSRSACertificateFile                   /etc/ssl/certs/proftpd.crt
TLSRSACertificateKeyFile                /etc/ssl/private/proftpd.key
TLSOptions                              NoCertRequest EnableDiags NoSessionReuseRequired
TLSVerifyClient                         off
TLSRequired                             on
TLSRenegotiate                          required off
</IfModule>
```
Now we need to restart ProFTPD
```sh
service proftpd restart
```

## Step 1.3 - Creating a ftp user
Replace in the next command `USERNAME` with a username and `PATH` with the path to which the user should have access to
```sh
adduser USERNAME --shell /bin/false --home /PATH --ingroup ftpuser
```

# Conclusion
Now you have set up a FTP Server with encryption. <br>

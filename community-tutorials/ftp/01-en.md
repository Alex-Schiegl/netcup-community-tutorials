# Introduction
This tutorial will show you, how you can install a ftp server on a Debian Server <br>
For this, we will install ProFTPD <br>
I am doing this on a debian 11 server (Netcup RS 2000), but it also should work on other debian versions <br>
This is an advenced version of https://github.com/SanCraftDev/Debian-Setup/blob/main/README.md#proftpd

# Requirements
You need a Debian Server with an Internet Connection, which is accessible from the internet over a static IP on a port of your choice.  <br>
You also need root permissions on your server.

# Step 1 - Installing Wireguard
First you need to connect to your server over ssh.
Then we are going to switch to the root user and are going to update the system, and then we are going to install the ProFTPD Server
```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install wget curl sudo nano proftpd -y
addgroup ftpuser
curl -L -o /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2020Sanoj/community-tutorials/ftp/community-tutorials/ftp/configs/proftpd.conf
service proftpd restart
```

## Step 1.1 - Creating a ftp user
Replace in the next command "USERNAME" with a username and "PATH" with the path to which the user should have access to
```sh
adduser USERNAME --shell /bin/false --home /PATH --ingroup ftpuser
```

# Conclusion
Now you have set up a FTP Server. <br>

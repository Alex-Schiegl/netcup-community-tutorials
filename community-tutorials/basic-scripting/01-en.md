# Introduction
In this tutorial, we will see how we can write basic POSIX compatible scripts. Scripts are very necessary in system administration and automation because once they are written, they make many tasks much easier.
# Requirements
- A server
- A text editor (for example Nano or Vim)
- Basic knowledge about the command line
# The Shebang
Every script starts with the shebang. It specifies the path of the intepreter.
For example:
```
#!/bin/bash
```
Or:
```
#!/bin/sh
```
Those are the most common shebangs you will see. The difference between them is that the first script uses Bash as its intepreter while the other one is POSIX compliant and will run with every POSIX compliant shell like Bash. `/bin/sh` scripts have the advantage that they will run on most systems while `/bin/bash` scripts only work with Bash but can therefore use some useful Bash extensions. This tutorial will focus on POSIX compliant scripts so we can in theory also execute our script with a shell like Dash instead of Bash.
**In the following examples, the shebang will be omitted but in your actual scripts, it should always be present.**
# Executing commands
A script is basically nothing more than a list of commands:
```sh
echo "Hello World"
echo "This is a tutorial about scripting"
```
# Comments
Comments are ignored by the intepreter and can be used to clarify things. They can be created by writing a `#` before the message:
```sh
# This comment will be ignored by the interpreter

# The following command will echo something
echo Hello World
```
# Variables
Variables hold values and can be created like this:
```sh
var="A variable"
second_var="A second variable"
```
The contents of a variable can be accessed this way:
```sh
# Prints "A variable"
echo "$var"
```
(The `"` can be omitted in some cases but it is recommend to add them to avoid problems)
## Setting the Value of a Variable to the Output of a Command
The value of a variable can be the output (STDOUT) of a command.
```sh
# The value of "var" is the output of the command "cat file".
var=$(cat file)
```
# If Statements
An important feature of scripting are If statements. Let's take a look at them.
## About Commands
Every command has an exit code. It is either 0 (everything went fine) or something other than 0 (something went wrong). In If statements, our condition is a command. If its exit code is 0, the if statement will be executed and if not, it will be skipped.
## Syntax
```sh
if <COMMAND>
then
	<COMMAND>
	<COMMAND>
	...
fi
```
So let's take a look at this example:
```sh
if ping -c 1 -W 3 8.8.8.8
then
	echo "There is an active internet connection"
fi
```
If the ping to `8.8.8.8` is successful, the message will be printed. We can also print another message if there is not an internet connection. So let's add an `else` statement:
```sh
if ping -c 1 -W 3 8.8.8.8
then
	echo "There is an active internet connection"
else
	echo "There is not an active internet connection"
fi
```
## Comparing numbers
If we want to compare numbers, there isn't an actual program. We will need to use our shell features:
```sh
first_var="1"
second_var="2"

if [ $first_var -gt $second_var ]
then
	echo "The first number is greater than the second"
else
	echo "The first number is not greater than the second"
fi
```
`[ $first_var -gt $second_var ]` is actually nothing more than a command provied by our shell. Its exit code is 0 if `first_var` is greater than `second_var` or 1 if that isn't the case. So in general, `-gt` checks whether the first variable is greater than the second. Of course, there are other checks as well:
- `-gt`: Second number is greater than the second number
- `-ge`: First number is greater than or equal the second number
- `-lt`: First number is smaller than the second number
- `-le`: First number is smaller than or equal the second number
- `-eq`: Both numbers are the same
## Else If Statements
When comparing two numbers, there can be three cases:
- The first number is greater than the second
- Both numbers are the same
- The second number is greater than the first

In a script, we can check these conditions with an `if`, an `elif` and an `else` statement:
```sh
first_var="1"
second_var="2"

if [ $first_var -gt $second_var ]
then
	echo "The first number is greater than the second"
elif [ $first_var -eq $second_var ]
	echo "Both numbers are the same"
else
	echo "The second number is greater than the first"
fi
```
## Negating If Statements
If statements can be negated using `!`, which means that the if statement will be executed if it actually wouldn't and the other way around:
```sh
first_var="1"
second_var="2"

# This if statement will be executed if the first number is not greater than the second number.
if ! [ $first_var -gt $second_var ]
then
	echo "The second number is greater than the first or both numbers are the same"
fi
```
## String Comparison
Strings can be compared like this:
```sh
first_var="hello"
second_var="hello"

if [ "$first_var" = "$second_var" ]
then
	echo "The first string is the same as the second"
fi
```
Note the `"`: They are not needed when numbers are compared but when strings are compared, they must be included.
## Comparing the Output of Commands
Let's compare the content of two files:
```sh
if [ "$(cat file1)" = "$(cat file2)" ]
then
	echo "file1 and file2 have the same contents"
fi
```
## Other Checks
Checking if a variable is exists:
```sh
# This If statement will be executed
if [ -z "$var" ]
then
	echo "Variable "var" does not exist"
fi
```
Checking if a file exists:
```sh
if [ -f "file" ]
then
	echo The file with the name "file" does exist"
fi
```
# The Sleep Command
We can use the `sleep` command to add a delay into our script (in seconds):
```sh
echo "Hello"

# Let's wait 3 seconds
sleep 3

echo "World"
```
# Basic Maths
Let's see how we can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers:
```sh
first_var="10"
second_var="5"

# Addition
result_addition=$(($first_var + $second_var))
echo "$first_var + $second_var = $result_addition"

# Subtraction
result_subtraction=$(($first_var - $second_var))
echo "$first_var - $second_var = $result_addition"

# Multiplication
result_multiplication=$(($first_var * $second_var))
echo "$first_var * $second_var = $result_addition"

# Division
result_division=$(($first_var / $second_var))
echo "$first_var / $second_var = $result_addition"
```
Note that in Bash, there are not floating point numbers. This means that the quotient of 3 and 4 (`$((3 / 4))`) will be 0. Instead, a tool like `bc` is needed.
# While Loops
While loops are executing commands as long as the exit code of a certain command is 0.
## Syntax
```sh
while <COMMAND>
do
	<COMMAND>
	<COMMAND>
	...
done
```
Infinite While statements are often needed to execute something periodically. Let's take a look at them:
```sh
while true
do
	sleep 2

	echo "Hello World"
done
```
In this case, `true` is again nothing more than a command provided by our shell which always has the exit code 0. While statements often contain sleep statements so they are not executing too fast. 

Also, we can utilize While statements to execute something for example 5 times:
```sh
i=0

while [ $i -lt 5 ]
do
	echo "Current iteration: $i"

	i=$(($i + 1))
done
```
# Running the Script
First, the script must be made executable:
```sh
$ chmod +x my-script
```
Then, we can already run it:
```sh
$ /path/to/my-script
```
If the script is our current working directory, it can be executed like this:
```sh
$ ./my-script
```
# Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learnt how we can write basic POSIX compliant scripts including commands, comments, variables, If statements, maths and delays.

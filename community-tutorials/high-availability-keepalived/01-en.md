# Introduction
High-availability (HA) refers to the ability of a system to continue operating with a high probability despite the failure of one of its components. There are several applications that help us to achieve high-availability. In this tutorial we will use [keepalived](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived) an application for loadbalancing and high-availability, which uses the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP; [RFC5798](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5798)). 

Keepalived is used as a daemon that monitors the system state or certain conditions to automatically failover to a standby system if an error occurs. We will additionally use a [Netcup Failover-IPv4](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=1073) and a [Cloud vLAN Free](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2284).

Please note that this is not an absolute beginners tutorial. I use references to other tutorials or the official documentation of used applications. If there are already instructions, I see no reason to write them again. So the main point here is how to implement a high availability setup with the mentioned products in the Netcup environment.

# Requirements
- Two Servers either [vServers](https://www.netcup.de/vserver/vps.php) or [Root Servers](https://www.netcup.de/vserver/) with Ubuntu/Debian
- [Failover IPv4](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=1073)
- [Cloud vLAN Free](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2284) (or higher)
- Access to your [Customer Control Panel (CCP)](https://www.customercontrolpanel.de) & [Server Control Panel (SCP)](https://www.servercontrolpanel.de)
- Access to a user with root privileges 

I assume that you have already booked the mentioned products and fulfill the stated requirements. I will simply refer to the two servers as server 1 (s1) and server 2 (s2). If I am not stating a specific server it means that the commands need to be executed on both servers.

# Step 1 - Setup Cloud vLAN
## Step 1.1 - Preparation SCP
### Step 1.1.1 - Log in to your [SCP](https://www.servercontrolpanel.de), either directly or via the autologin feature in your [CCP](https://www.customercontrolpanel.de)
### Step 1.1.2 - Choose a server (from the list on the top left) 
### Step 1.1.3 - Navigate to the *Network* section (in the left sidebar)
### Step 1.1.4 - Choose *add Ethernet Interface* (on the top right)
### Step 1.1.5 - Select your Cloud vLAN and choose *virtio* as the driver
### Step 1.1.6 - Select the second server and repeat the steps 1.1.3 - 1.1.5; then continue with 1.2
## Step 1.2 - Create interface
Log in to your servers and create a vLAN-configuration for the network interface via your favourite text editor e.g. `sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces.d/vlan.cfg`

**Example */etc/network/interfaces.d/vlan.cfg* for s1**
```
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 10.132.0.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
```
**Example */etc/network/interfaces.d/vlan.cfg* for s2**
```
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 10.132.0.20
    netmask 255.255.255.0
```
## Step 1.3 - Restart networking 
```
sudo systemctl restart networking
```
## Step 1.4 - Verify vLAN Setup
There are various methods to verify if your vLAN is setup correctly. You could for example start with a simple check via `ip addr show`:
```
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether e6:1c:ef:12:66:ae brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.132.0.10/24 brd 10.132.0.255 scope global eth1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::e41c:efff:fe12:66ae/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
Besides your other network interfaces you can already see our new configured interface *eth1* on s1 with the IP 10.132.0.10 which we set in the *vlan.cfg* before.

Continue by doing a simple ping between s1 and s2 to ensure that you indeed have a working connection:
```
operator@s1:~$ ping 10.132.0.20 -c 5

PING 10.132.0.20 (10.132.0.20) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.450 ms
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.510 ms
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.403 ms
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.379 ms
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.402 ms

--- 10.132.0.20 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 104ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.379/0.428/0.510/0.053 ms
```
Then also check if the connection also works the other way around from s2 to s1. Now that we have confirmed our vLAN configuration we can continue with the rest of our setup.

# Step 2 - Setup Failover IPv4
## Step 2.1 - Preparation
### Step 2.1.1 - Log in to your [SCP](https://www.servercontrolpanel.de) either directly or via the [CCP](https://www.customercontrolpanel.de)
### Step 2.1.2 - Navigate to *Options* (on the top right)
### Step 2.1.3 - Navigate to *Webservice* (in the left sidebar)
### Step 2.1.4 - Activate the Webservice and set a secure *Webservice Password*
### Step 2.1.5 - Assign Failover IP
We determine that s1 should be our master server and therefore we want to assign the Failover IP to s1: Open the SCP, make sure to choose s1 and then navigate to *Network* in the left sidebar. You should see your Failover IPv4 in the IPv4 Section. Assign it to your server by clicking on *Route IP to Server*.
## Step 2.2 - Call Webservice to change routing
We now create a script on both servers, which will make a call to the [Netcup Webservice](https://www.netcup-wiki.de/wiki/Netcup_SCP_Webservice) to change the routing of our Failover IP in case of an error situation. This script is needed in our keepalived configuration which you will see in a moment.

**to\_master.sh**

```
#!/usr/bin/bash

CURL_REROUTE='
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1="http://enduser.service.web.vcp.netcup.de/">
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        <ns1:changeIPRouting>

            <destinationInterfaceMAC>YOUR_VSERVER_MAC</destinationInterfaceMAC>
        </ns1:changeIPRouting>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>'

CURL_CHECK='
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1="http://enduser.service.web.vcp.netcup.de/">
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        <ns1:getVServerIPs>
            <loginName>YOUR_LOGIN_NAME</loginName>

            <vserverName>YOUR_VSERVER_NAME</vserverName>
        </ns1:getVServerIPs>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>'

REROUTE_RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" -H "SOAPAction:" -d "$CURL_REROUTE" -X POST https://www.servercontrolpanel.de:443/WSEndUser?xsd=1)
CHECK_RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" -H "SOAPAction:" -d "$CURL_CHECK" -X POST https://www.servercontrolpanel.de:443/WSEndUser?xsd=1)
FAILOVER_IP_ACTIVE=$(echo $CHECK_RESULT | grep YOUR_FAILOVER_IP | wc -l)

n=0
while [ $n -lt 10 ] && [ $FAILOVER_IP_ACTIVE -eq 0 ]
do
    REROUTE_RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" -H "SOAPAction:" -d "$CURL_REROUTE" -X POST https://www.servercontrolpanel.de:443/WSEndUser?xsd=1)
    sleep 3
    CHECK_RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" -H "SOAPAction:" -d "$CURL_CHECK" -X POST https://www.servercontrolpanel.de:443/WSEndUser?xsd=1)
    FAILOVER_IP_ACTIVE=$(echo $CHECK_RESULT | grep YOUR_FAILOVER_IP | wc -l)
    n=$((n+1))
done
```
The above script changes the routing of the Failover IPv4 to the specified server. If the rerouting does not work for any reason, the script tries again until the maximum tries (in this case 10) are reached. Make sure to use your actual data wherever needed and to make the script executable with `sudo chmod +x to_master.sh`.

Hints:
- *YOUR\_LOGIN\_NAME* is your customer id.
- *YOUR\_WEBSERVICE\_PASSWORD* is the one we just set in step 2.1.4
- *YOUR\_FAILOVER\_IP* can be found in your CCP in the section *Products* or in the SCP in the *Network* section
- *YOUR\_VSERVER\_NAME* can be found in your SCP in the *General* section of the corresponding server
- *YOUR\_VSERVER\_MAC* can also be found in your SCP in the *General* section of the corresponding server (Note that you need the MAC of your primary interface not the MAC of the vLAN)

# Step 3 - Setup keepalived
## Step 3.1 - Install keepalived
Navigate to either the website [https://keepalived.org/download.html](https://keepalived.org/download.html) or the respective GitHub repository [https://github.com/acassen/keepalived](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived) and install the application as per the instructions available at [https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/blob/master/INSTALL](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/blob/master/INSTALL).
## Step 3.2 - Turn on Packet forwarding
In order for the keepalived service to forward packets you need to turn on forwarding in the kernel. Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and make sure to include the following line using your favourite text editor e.g. `sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf`:
```
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```
For the changes to take effect execute `sudo sysctl -p`

## Step 3.3 - Configure keepalived
I will provide a basic configuration here which is a good starting point for further tweaks if needed. With this configuration s1 starts as master and s2 starts as backup. If s1 is for any reason not sending adverts anymore / s2 does not receive adverts anymore, s2 will automatically jump in as a failover.

One interesting parameter to start tweaking is the *advert\_int* parameter. This parameter on the one hand determines how often an advert should be sent (every 2 seconds in this case) and on the other hand determines that if after 3 * *advert\_int* seconds no advert was received the failover is triggered (so in this case; after 3 * 2 = 6 seconds).

If a server changes from BACKUP to MASTER state the *notify\_master* script, which is our *to\_master.sh* (that reroutes our Failover IPv4), is triggered.

But there are much more methods you can use to trigger a failover besides the adverts. You could for example also track files, scripts, processes, interfaces etc. to increase/decrease the priority and trigger the failover based on this. Especially scripts arev very flexible and offer the possibility for more sophisticated checks. If you are interested in more configuration methods this [Red Hat Article](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/advanced-keepalived) covers some configurations.

**Example */etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf* for s1**
```
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth1
    virtual_router_id 101
    priority 255
    advert_int 2
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass CUSTOM_PASSWORD
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        10.132.0.100
    }
    notify_master /PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPT/to_master.sh
}
```

**Example */etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf* for s2**
```
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface eth1
    virtual_router_id 101
    priority 254
    advert_int 2
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass CUSTOM_PASSWORD
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        10.132.0.100
    }
    notify_master /PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPT/to_master.sh
}
```
Note: The *CUSTOM\_PASSWORD* should be a secure password set by you and must be the same for s1 and s2.

## Step 3.4 - Restart keepalived
```
sudo systemctl restart keepalived
```

# Conclusion
You should now have a running configuration of keepalived, which automatically triggers a rerouting of your Failover IPv4 to a backup server if the master server is down. You can verify if your system is set up correctly by turning s1 off while watching if s2 detects that failure situation and reroutes the Failover IPv4. 

Some additional remarks:
- If you have any problems with keepalived you may want to review your firewall settings and make sure that VRRP (protocol 112) is allowed. 
- You can check `sudo tcpdump proto 112 -i eth1` to see if the servers are receiving each others adverts.
- There are many keepalived configuration options to play around with. I highly recommend to read deeper into it if you need something that is not covered by this tutorial.
- There is always a sweet spot between short downtime in case of a failover and the prevention of false or frequent failovers due to overly strict constraints (flapping).
- It should be noted that the call to the webservice and the rerouting of the Failover IP may take several seconds.

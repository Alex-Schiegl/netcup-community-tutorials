# Introduction
This tutorial describes how to generate a ssh-key and save the ssh-key in the SCP.\
The saved SSH-Key can be used on further Image installations.
# Requirements

* Server (root or VPS)

# Step 1 - Generate the SSH-Key
Open a terminal.
Generate the ssh-key with following command:

```
Define location of the SSH-Key.\
The default setting is `~/.ssh/id_rsa` ( ~ points to the home folder of your current user ).\

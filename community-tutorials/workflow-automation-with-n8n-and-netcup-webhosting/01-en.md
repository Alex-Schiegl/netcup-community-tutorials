# Introduction
In this tutorial I want to show you, how to install the open source workflow automation tool [n8n](https://n8n.io) on your Netcup shared webhosting instance. This is especially useful if you want to automate some tasks, change your slack status, when you are in a meeting or want to build your own No-Code app.

# Requirements
To get started, all you need is a Netcup Webhosting instance with NodeJS support (Webhosting 4000 and above) and a cup of coffee â˜•.

# Step 1 - Login to your Webhosting Control Panel
First you must log into your Webhosting Control Panel. To do this, please enter your `xxxxx.webhosting.systems` domain in the address bar of your browser of choice and enter your credentials.

After that you should see something like the following (of course there can be some small design differences):

# Step 2 - Setup a domain
In this step we are going to create a new subdomain for our n8n instance. On Netcup each Webhosting gets a free `hostingXXXXXX.xxxxx.netcup.net` domain. In this tutorial we will use this one to host n8n. If you want to setup a custom domain, look at the [official documentation](https://www.netcup-wiki.de/wiki/Domains_CCP).

## Step 2.1 - Create a new subdomain
To add a new subdomain, click **New Subdomain** at the top left corner. This will guide you to a new page, where you can select the parental domain and the document root of your subdomain.

In this case I will with our inclusive domain and `/httpdocs/n8n/public` as the document root.
> Please make sure to add `/public` at the end of the document root. Otherwise, you will have problems with NodeJS.

## Step 2.2 - Setup HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
After the domain is created, we need to issue a Let's Encrypt certificate for it, so we can access our domain over HTTPS.

To this select the domain at the overview and click the Let's Encrypt button.

In the following window you now must enter your Email address. After that you can click **Install** to issue a new certificate.

>Please note that Netcup will renew this certificate for you automatically.

# Step 3 - Add the code
Now that we have our domain ready and set up, let's concentrate on the coding part.

So, let's jump over to our `/httpdocs/n8n` directory (this time without `/public` ðŸ˜‰), you can do this by clicking **Files** on the left or **File Manager** at the domain config and add the following two files:

`package.json`
```json
{
  "name": "n8n",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "n8n": "*",
    "sqlite3": "*"
  }
}
```

and

`.npmrc`
```
scripts-prepend-node-path=true
```

In the first file we define the version of n8n and sqlite3 (a dependency of n8n), we want to install (in this case the latest: `"*"`). The second one just ensures that everything is fine on our shared webhosting.

# Step 4 - Start the app
Now that everything is in place, it is time to setup the final NodeJS configuration.

To do this, go to **Websites & Domains** on the left side bar and select your domain. Then click **Node.js** and you will see a new page. Here click on the **Enable Node.js** button to active Node.

Now that Node is running you can specify a Node.js Version. I recommend using the latest, but you must try which one works with n8n. Currently (November 2021) Node.js version 14 is working well.

## Step 4.1 - Install NPM dependecies
Now that Node is up and running, it's time to install all dependencies. You can do this by clicking the **NPM install** button at the top menu.

If everything works fine, it should exit with some warnings, but we can ignore these.

## Step 4.2 - Setup environment variables
To prevent others from accessing our n8n installation, we will no setup a simple password authentication as well as some required environment variables. For further setup please check out [this article](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/environment-variables.html).

To add our variables click **specify** under *Custom environment variables* and enter the following:
| Variable                | Value                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE   | true                                        |
| N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER     | *your-username*                             |
| N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | *your-password*                             |
| N8N_HOST                | n8n.hostingXXXXXX.xxxxx.netcup.net          |
| N8N_PROTOCOL            | https                                       |
| WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL      | https://n8n.hostingXXXXXX.xxxxx.netcup.net/ |
| VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API    | https://n8n.hostingXXXXXX.xxxxx.netcup.net/ |

After you're done click **Restart App** and go over to your domain.

# Conclusion

Now, you should have a completely self-hosted version of n8n, running on your Netcup Webhosting.

For getting started, I recommend [n8n's workflow collection](https://n8n.io/workflows) with many interesting examples.

If you want to learn more about n8n and their mission feel free to visit their website at [n8n.io](https://n8n.io) or their really good [documentation](https://docs.n8n.io)

# Introduction

In this tutorial I describe how we can install the wiki software Bookstack on a Debian 11 server. 

We use Docker for installation to keep the installation relatively simple. Bookstack is a free software for documenting certain information. Among other things, the software supports uploading files and embedding source code. Therefore, this wiki is suitable for all kinds of people who are interested in documenting things. 

The reading time of this article is approximately 10 minutes. A time of about 30 minutes should be planned for the implementation of this project. In terms of difficulty, this is in the beginner range. In this tutorial, we will use the hostname srv1.quicksrv.de. This can be chosen freely. You should be able to open our wiki with a browser on the website wiki.website.de afterwards.

# Requirements
The following are the requirements for the system to successfully complete the installation: 
- Debian 11 operating system 
- Administration user 
- SSH access or console access 
- At least 30 GB hard disk space (depending on the scope and type of documentation) 
- At least 1 GB of RAM - 
- At least 1 CPU core 
- One IPv4 or IPv6 address

For this project, the smallest VPS 200 G10s vServer model is sufficient.

# Step 1 - Ordering the VPS
At the time of the creation of this tutorial (June 2023), the recommended product to be used as SSH proxy is [VPS 200 G10s](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2948). 
Existing customers can add the product easily and quickly.

# Step 2 - Basic configuration of the server
After provisioning of the server and the first login with the username `root` and the password sent by email, the first step is to update the basic configuration of the server.

1. Change the root password by means of `passwd`.
2. Import the current security updates with `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y`.
3. Change the hostname with hostname with `hostnamectl set-hostname NEW-NAME`

# Step 3 - Install docker on the server
After the basic server installation, we now need to install Docker. Docker allows us to launch applications in so-called containers, so as not to have problems with dependencies on multiple applications. Furthermore, an application is much easier to install and update because the user does not have to deal with the installation of different packages. 
1. To install Docker, the following script must be executed: 
`
`apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt install sudo -y`
`apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg -y`
`sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings`
`curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg`
`sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg`
`echo "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null` 
`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y`

2. To verify the installation, we enter the `docker compose version` command. The command line should now give us a version number. With this, we can make sure that our installation was successful and we can start installing our application.

# Step 4 - Install bookstack on the server
To install Bookstack now, in the first step we need a folder on our server to put the files there. We create this under `/opt/bookstack`. The location can be chosen freely.
`mkdir /opt/bookstack`

In the next step we change to the directory with the `cd` command.
`cd /opt/bookstack`
There we now create the `docker-compose.yml`, which is to be understood as the configuration file of our application.
We create the file with the nano editor. To do this, we enter the following command:
`nano docker-compose.yml`

In it we add the following content:

```
version: "2"
services:
  bookstack:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/bookstack
    container_name: bookstack
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - APP_URL=https://bookstack.example.com
      - DB_HOST=bookstack_db
      - DB_PORT=3306
      - DB_USER=bookstack
      - DB_PASS=<yourdbpass>
      - DB_DATABASE=bookstackapp
    volumes:
      - ./bookstack_app_data:/config
    ports:
      - 6875:80
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - bookstack_db
  bookstack_db:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb
    container_name: bookstack_db
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<yourdbpass>
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=bookstackapp
      - MYSQL_USER=bookstack
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=<yourdbpass>
    volumes:
      - ./bookstack_db_data:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

In the file we now only change the following things:
- Under `APP_URL` we enter the domain for our wiki
- Under `DB_PASS` we enter a password of the database user
- Under `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` we enter a strong password.
- Under `MYSQL_PASSWORD` we give the database user a password, which we also have to enter in the first point.

Now we can start the application with `docker compose up -d`. 
The process is taking a while now, but after max. 5 minutes we should be able to reach the website.
The Default login is with username: `admin@admin.com`and password: `password`. 

# Conclusion
The wiki system can now be used. The settings can be adjusted in the settings.

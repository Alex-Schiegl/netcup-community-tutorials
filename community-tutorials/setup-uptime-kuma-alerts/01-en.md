# Introduction

This tutorial is a follow-up of the tutorial [Setup of Uptime Kuma Standalone on Ubuntu with a reverse proxy](https://community.netcup.com/en/tutorials/ubuntu-uptime-kuma-standalone-installation).

This tutorial describes how to set up Uptime Kuma to send real-time alerts to various services.  
The Services supported by this tutorial are (other tutorials may be added soon):

- Discord
- E-Mail
- Telegram
- Any other Webhook

For people starting with Uptime Kuma, I recommend using Telegram, as in my opinion it is the easiest to set up.

Just jump to the section you want to use by clicking on the matching Menu-Entry on the left.

# Discord

   1. Open your Discord Server Settings
   2. Click on "Integrations"

   5. Enter a Name for the Webhook and choose the Channel you want to send the messages to
   6. Click on "Copy Webhook URL"

9. Paste the Webhook URL you copied earlier into the "Discord Webhook URL" field
10. Choose a Bot Display Name (this is the name that will be displayed in Discord)
11. Choose a custom Prefix. Here you can mention roles or persons to ping them.
12. Choose "Default Enabled" if it should be enabled by default when creating a new monitor
13. If you turn on "Apply on all existing monitors" it will apply this notification to all existing monitors as well

# Introduction
This tutorial will show you, how you can install the HTTP proxy squid on your Debian or Ubuntu server "RS 2000" and how you can connect to the proxy, from almost any client. <br>
I am doing this on a debian 11 server, but it also should work on other debian versions and on ubuntu <br>
This is an advenced version of https://github.com/SanCraftDev/Debian-Setup/blob/main/README.md#Squid-HTTP-Proxy---with-Password-Authentication

# Requirements
You need a Debian or Ubuntu Server with an Internet Connection, which is accessible from the internet over a static IP on Port 8449. <br>
You also need root permissions on your server.

# Step 1 - Installing Squid
First you need to connect to your server over ssh.
Then we are going to switch to the root user and are going to update the system, install required packages and then we are going to install the squid HTTP proxy.
```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install curl sudo wget apache2-utils nano -y
apt install squid -y
```

# Step 1.1 - Inserting the configuration
Now we need to insert a configuration to the squid proxy. <br>
This Configuration allows connecting to the HTTP proxy using a username and a password, it is setting the port to 8449 and makes your origin IP invisible for the Web servers you visit.
```sh
curl -L -o /etc/squid/squid.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2020Sanoj/community-tutorials/main/community-tutorials/squid/configs/squid.conf
```

## Step 1.2 - Creating users
Now we need to create users, so that they can access the proxy. <br>
Please replace "USERNAME" in the next command with an actual Username, which you want to use to log in to the proxy with a password.
```sh
htpasswd -c /etc/squid/passwords USERNAME
```
Now enter a new secure Password. <br>
Repeat this step depending on how many users you need, which should be able to use this proxy.

## Step 1.3 - Starting Squid
To enable the inserted configuration, we need to restart the squid proxy, to do this, simply run: <br>
The restart may take a longer while.
```sh
service squid restart
```

# Step 2 - Setting up the devices

## Step 2.1 - Windows 11
Open your settings app and go to "network and internet" <br>
Select Proxy and now select under "Manual proxy setup" the "Set up" Button right from "Use a proxy server" <br>
Now enabled "Use a proxy server" now enter under "Proxy IP address" the IP address or the hostname of your proxy server and under "Port" the port "8449" <br>
Now activate the Checkbox "Don't use the proxy server for local (intranet) addresses" <br>
Now you can click the Button "Save" <br>
Now you will sometimes be asked for one of the username and the password of this username, which we created in step 1.2

## Step 2.2 - Windows 10
Open your settings app and go to "network and internet" <br>
Select Proxy and now activate under "Manual proxy setup" the "use proxy server" <br>
Now enter under "address" the IP address or the hostname of your proxy server and under "Port" the port "8449" <br>
Now activate the Checkbox "Don't use the proxy server for local (intranet) addresses" <br>
Now you can click the Button "Save" <br>
Now you will sometimes be asked for one of the username and the password of this username, which we created in step 1.2

## Step 2.3 - Android
Go to in your settings app and go to your Wi-Fi settings. <br>
Press your Wi-Fi network for some time and select "change" or "settings" or if there is something like a settings button direct shown on your connected Wi-Fi network press this button <br>
Now click on "show more" and select proxy, here select "manual" <br>
Now enter under "address" or "hostname" the IP address or the hostname of your proxy server and under "Port" the port "8449" <br>
Now you can click the Button "Save" <br>
Now you will sometimes be asked for one of the username and the password of this username, which we created in step 1.2

## Step 2.4 - IOS - iPadOS
Go to in your settings app and go to your Wi-Fi settings. <br>
Press your Wi-Fi network and now select "configure proxy", now select "manual" <br>
Now enter under "server" the IP address or the hostname of your proxy server and under "Port" the port "8449" <br>
Now activate the Checkbox "Authentication" and enter your username and the password of this username, which we created in step 1.2 <br>
Now you can click the upper Button, "Save"

## Step 2.5 - macOS
Go to your Settings and select "network", there select your Ethernet or Wi-Fi network <br>
There select "advanced" and now "Proxies", here select "Web Proxy (HTTP)" and "Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS)" <br>
Now enter your IP address or the hostname of your proxy server and the port "8449" <br>
Now activate the Checkbox "Proxy server requires password" and now enter your username and the password of this username, which we created in step 1.2 <br>
Now click "Ok" and then "apply"

## Step 2.6 - Linux
Run the following commands to install required packages and then to open the proxy configuration file
```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install curl sudo wget nano -y
sudo nano /etc/environment
```
Now add there the following lines and replace "username" with a username and "password" with the password of this username, from one of th users, which we created in step 1.2 and replace "hostname" with the IP address or the hostname of your proxy server and  "port" with the port "8449":
```sh
http_proxy="http://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/"
https_proxy="http://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/"
no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,::1"
```

# Conclusion
Now you have set up a squid HTTP proxy with username and password protection. And have connected your devices with this proxy. <br>

# Introduction
This tutorial explains how to install a [Seafile](https://www.seafile.com/en/home/) server onto a virtual server (vServer or Rootserver).
After following these steps, the user installed a complete Seafile server including its database with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
Furthermore, the Seafile service will be secured with a free LetsEncrypt certificate to be reachable via HTTPS (SSL/TLS).

Please keep in mind that the installation of the Seafile server in this tutorial uses ports 80 and 443 exclusively. This means that you are unable to server other web services on the system.

# Requirements
* A virtual server like the **VPS200G8** in my example. Keep in mind that you chose a properly sized product to fulfill your storage needs. (The 20 GB of the VPS200G8 chosen in this tutorial might be too small for your cloud.)
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) 10 or newer installed on your vServer. Other Linux distributions like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) will also fulfill the requirement for this tutorial.
* Docker and Docker-Compose installed on your system. For example, use this tutorial: https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/community-tutorials/install-docker/01-en.md
    * You can check your Docker installation by running these commands:

```bash
$ docker --version
Docker version 20.10.10, build b485636
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
```
(The version numbers do not have to match exactly but the commands must not return any errors.)


# Step 1 - Create a working environment
To use Docker-Compose files, one has to create a working environment that usually consists of a dedicated directory and a docker-compose file (`docker-compose.yml`). One way to organize different Docker-Compose "projects" is to create folders in `/srv`

* Create Seafile Docker-Compose folder: `$ mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose/seafile`
* Create the data directory: `$ mkdir -p /srv/docker-compose/seafile/data`
* Change directory into the new folder: `$ cd /srv/docker-compose/seafile`
* Create an empty `docker-compose.yml` file: `$ touch docker-compose.yml`

# Step 2 - Configure the Seafile service
* Start your favorite editor to open the file `docker-compose.yml`. One of the easiest editors is `nano` which can be used like this: `$ nano docker-compose.yml`
* Paste the following template into the file:
```bash
version: '2.0'
services:
  # Database
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.5
    container_name: seafile-mysql
    environment:
      # TODO: Choose a root password for the MySQL database
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=db_dev
      - MYSQL_LOG_CONSOLE=true
    volumes:
      # Defines the mount path for the persistant data of the database
      - ./data/db:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - seafile-network

  # Memory Cache
  memcached:
    image: memcached:1.5.6
    container_name: seafile-memcached
    entrypoint: memcached -m 256
    networks:
      - seafile-network

  # Seafile server itself
  seafile:
    image: seafileltd/seafile-mc:latest
    container_name: seafile
    ports:
      # Port 80 = HTTP, Port 443 = HTTPS
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./data/seafile:/shared
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      # TODO: Paste the matching root password of the database here
      - DB_ROOT_PASSWD=db_dev
      # Defines the timezone. This example is for Germany
      - TIME_ZONE=Europe/Berlin
      # TODO: Define the email address of the root user
      - SEAFILE_ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@address.com
      # TODO: Define the password of the root user
      - SEAFILE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-super-secret-password
      - SEAFILE_SERVER_LETSENCRYPT=true
      # TODO: Change the URL of your Seafile server according to your domain
      - SEAFILE_SERVER_HOSTNAME=seafile.example.com
    depends_on:
      - db
      - memcached
    networks:
      - seafile-network

networks:
  seafile-network:
```
* Adapt all variables that are marked with `# TODO: ` according to your needs. Feel free to dig a little deeper and also understand all other variables!

# Step 3 - Deployment
* Download the Docker images for your Seafile containers: `$ docker-compose pull`
* Start your stack: `$ docker-compose up -d`
* You can check the live logs of your Seafile containers with this command: `$ docker-compose -tf logs`

All data will be saved in these subfolders:
* `/srv/docker-compose/seafile/data/db`
* `/srv/docker-compose/seafile/data/seafile`

# Step 4 - Using the web interface and creating user accounts
* After starting (deploying) your Seafile instance, you can navigate your favorite web browser to the URL previously specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file (in my example this is https://v220211126567167491.powersrv.de).
(Notice the valid TLS/SSL certificate visible in the screenshots!)

![Login page](images/00_login.png)

* You can now login with the administrator/root credentials provided in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Seafile will welcome you!

* After closing the welcome page, the service will present its normal file browser.

* Normally, one wants to create unprivileged user accounts for the users. This can easily be done within the administration panel (in the web interface). Click on the user avatar image on the right top corner and *System-Administration*.

* Under the menu *Benutzer*/*Users* you can create new user accounts by clicking on *Benutzer hinzuf√ºgen*/*Add users*.

# Conclusion
Through the use of Docker and Docker-Compose, an administrator can deploy a new Seafile instance including a valid TLS/SSL certificate within minutes.
This tutorial showed how to install Seafile along with its caching mechanism and the needed MySQL database with Docker-Compose.
Moreover, the Seafile service got configured to allow TLS/SSL secured HTTPS requests.

## Future considerations
1. You may be interested in the usage of the official Seafile clients, e.g., for Windows or Linux desktop systems. Check them out [here](https://www.seafile.com/en/download/).
1. You may be interested to provide the credentials, e.g., the administrator/root password, outside of your `docker-compose.yml` file. This can be achieved by the usage of `.env` files.
1. You may be interested in combining the Seafile Docker-Compose stack with another reverse proxy to allow a parallel installation of Seafile with, e.g., other web services like a website.
1. Backups are important! Therefore, you should back up the data in `/srv/docker-compose/seafile` regularly. Keep in mind that you have to shut down the Docker-Compose stack (e.g., with `$ docker-compose down`) beforehand to create consistent backups.

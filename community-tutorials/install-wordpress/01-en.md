# Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to install:

- Wordpress

I am doing this on a Debian 11 server (RS Zimtstern) but the installations should also work on other Debian versions.

# Requirements

You need Apache2, PHP and MariaDB installed on your server see [here](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md)

## Installing WordPress

WordPress is an open source website / blogging software. <br>

- Follow Step [1.5](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md#step-15-installing-a-configuration-for-the-web-server) and create a new domain or subdomain for the website. <br>
- Switch to the folder you have just created (replace FOLDER with the name of the folder):

```sh
cd /var/www/FOLDER
curl -L -o latest.zip https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
unzip latest.zip
mv ./wordpress/* ./
rm -r wordpress
```

- Create a database for the web service [(see Step 1.7)](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md#step-17---creating-a-database-optional).<br>
- Open WordPress via https://DOMAIN/wp-admin/setup-config.php and follow the steps shown.

# Introduction
This tutorial aims to show how tp setup [MLFlow]() server for experiment tracking. Such a server is crucial for meaningful AI development and data science, since slight parameter changes may have a huge impact on the performance.
Having a central instance for storing such information is also beneficial with regard to collaborarion.
Additionally, MLFlow also provides basic visualization for tracked information, making it easy to compare models to each other.

Unfortunately, MLFlow does not provide any authentication feature. So this tutorial also covers setting up http basic authentication with nginx and to access the MLFlow instance from a python script.

# Requirements
A tracking server does not need much ressources, in opposition to training instances.
Therefor, a simple VPS, e.g. [VPS 200 G10s](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2948) should be enough at the moment.
In the long run more harddrive space may be necessary.
The main requirement for this tutorial is having linux server with a user with `sudo` rights.

# Step 1 - Ordering the VPS
For thus tutorial we are using the [VPS 200 G10s](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2948), but any VPS or root server should be usable.
After getting access to the serer, I provisioned it with the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS minimal image provided in the SCP. In addition, I enabled a custom user named `amjad` and "shh key only" login for this specific user during the setup (see screenshot underneath).

# Step 2 - Install system dependencies
After provisioning the server should be ready for login with the provided user (`amjad` in this tutorial).
First of all we should run updates:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

After all updates are done, some applications need to be installed:
* `python3`: MLFlow is mainly written in python
* `pip`: python package manager
* `postgressql`: MLFlow provides different backends for storing the information. By default a .yaml file is used, but an SQL database is better, with regard to write and read performance, when the satabase grows.
* nginx: as reverse proxy to provide authentication

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip postgresql nginx
```

Typically, postgres and nginx service start automatically.

# Step 3 - Prepare database
Next we need to setup the database. This is done by the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo -u postgres psql
could not change directory to "/home/amjad": Permission denied
psql (14.7 (Ubuntu 14.7-0ubuntu0.22.04.1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# create database mlflow;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# create user mlflow with password 'e90bc298ae451051dda2686413304edb';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# grant all privileges on database mlflow to mlflow;
GRANT
```

The password needs to be provided as md5 hash. Here the password is `airocks`, please use a more secure one, when setting up your server.


# Step 4 - Use as SOCKS server
To use Chrome or another browser in such a way that it handles all traffic through the SSH proxy, you use it as a SOCKS proxy. This way, you can show streaming services, for example, that you are actually located in Germany if the geolocation of your own IP doesn't work properly.

Technically, in this case, your own computer is the SOCKS proxy that uses SSH proxy for forwarding. Therefore, `localhost` is specified as the (SOCKS) proxy server (see figure below).

Start an SSH session on your own computer with the following command:

`ssh -p 443 -D8080 -N root@v11111111.quicksrv.de`. Replace the example `v11111111.quicksrv.de` with the correct server name.

Then start Chrome in a second window with the following command:

`google-chrome --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:8080" --host-resolver-rules="MAP * ~NOTFOUND , EXCLUDE localhost"`.

This results in Chrome using the SOCKS proxy as nameserver for name resolution, which protects your privacy.

# Step 5 - Use as jump server
To access other servers whose SSH daemon is bound only to port 22 (or another), use the command:

`ssh -J root@v11111111.quicksrv.de:443 root@myserver.com`

Replace our example `v11111111.quicksrv.de` with the correct proxy server name. Instead of `myserver.com` you must specify the server to which you want to connect through the proxy.

# Conclusion
SSH proxy can now be used. It is recommended to perform tests before productive use.

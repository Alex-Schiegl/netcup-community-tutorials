# Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll have a look at how to use the more secure SSH keys to login into your server instead of the weaker password method. 

# Requirements
- A server (root or VPS)
- A PC/laptop running linux

# Step 1 - Generate SSH keys

For this tutorial, we assume, that you have a linux OS running (Windows users can use WSL). 

We first need to generate our SSH keypair, that will later allow us to login into our remote machine. 
For that we can run the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen
```

This command will by default generate a key with 2048-Bit-RSA encryption. If you need more security, you can also add the `-b 4096` flag to this command to generate keys with 4096-Bit-RSA encryption.
You now have to choose, where the key will be stored - the default is `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (where ~ points to the home folder of your user on linux).
Next the script asks you to enter a password, which will prevent the use of this key without a password. If you don't want to protect this key with a password, you can just hit enter (not recommend).

If the key has been successfully generated, the output should look like:
```bash
Your identification has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:G+UCCe2r45jt7az1cTVEZj4R1/B8CU7eAMNmw0DsAOA username@host
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|   .oo. oo+oB=oo |
|  .  ..o . @=o+oo|
|   E .o o + =o o+|
|      .. + . .  .|
|       .S . o    |
|      .  + . .   |
|     .. o .      |
|   +o+ . o       |
|  oo=++ .        |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

# Step 2 - Copy the public key to the remote server

## Step 2.1 - Using `ssh-copy-id`

We now have the private and the public keys on our local system, but we need to transfer the public key to our server.
For that we can use the built in `ssh-copy-id` of our linux OS. 

The command looks like this:
```bash
ssh-copy-id username@host
```

so for example
```bash
ssh-copy-id maxmusterman@37.34.15.3
```
where `37.34.15.3` is the IP of the server.

When connecting to the server for the first time, the system asks wether it should trust the key fingerprint of the server:
```bash
The authenticity of host '37.34.15.3 (37.34.15.3)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d5:f9:88:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ab:d6:6f:22:fe.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Now type `yes` and the script connects to the server:
```
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
maxmusterman@37.34.15.3's password:
```

Next enter the password of your remote server. If the connection was successful, the script will copy the public key into the `~/.ssh` folder of this user account:
```bash
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with: "ssh 'maxmusterman@37.34.15.3'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

## Step 2.2 - Manual copy the key

If `ssh-copy-id` is not available on your system, you can also connect to your server via SSH and then copy the key manually. 
On you local machine run the following command to get the content of the key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

The output should look like this:
```ssh
ssh-rsa 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 username@host
```

Now copy this key (all of it including the `ssh-rsa` part and also the `username@host` in the end) and connect to your server via SSH. 
If you are connected to your remote server, create a new file in the `~/.ssh` folder named `authorized_keys`:
```
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Next paste the earlier copied content of the public key into this file and safe it with `Ctrl+O` and close the file with `Ctrl+x`.

Now the key should be ready to use.

# Step 3 - Test the key

The last step is to test the key. Therefore logout of your server, if you are still logged in and login again, using the usual SSH command:
```
ssh username@host
```

But now instead of using the username password, the SSH key will be used to login. If you set a password for the key file earlier, you need to use it in order for the key to work.

# Step 4 - Disable password login (Optional)

To make the whole login process more secure, you can disable login via password in general and only use the SSH key. 
For that we need to edit our `sshd_config` file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Next we need to change this option
```diff
- #PasswordAuthentication yes
+ PasswordAuthentication no
```

and restart the SSH service:
```
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

From now on, only the login via SSH keys work.

# Conclusion

Now there should be a SSH key on your server, that you can use to login to it.
This method is much saver than the usual password method and can improve the server security.

# Introduction
This tutorial will guide you through the process of automatically deploying a web app over FTP using GitHub Actions. By following these steps, you'll be able to set up a continuous deployment workflow that automatically pushes your web app files to an FTP server whenever changes are made to your GitHub repository.

# Requirements
* GitHub Account
* GitHub Repository with a webapp you want to deploy
* Server which you can access over ftp

I used Webhosting 2000, but every other Webhosting offer should do the trick.

# Step 1 - Get your FTP credentials and add them on GitHub
When you order a Webhosting xxxx package from Netcup you also get the Plesk Webhosting Control Panel.
   1. In your Webhosting panel go to "Websites & Domains".
   2. From the list choose the domain you want to host your site on.
   3. Under "Files & Databases", select "FTP Access".
   4. Click on the button "Add an FTP Account".
   5. Now choose an account name, directory and password for your account, remember or write down your credentials for later.
   6. Select "OK".
Now we need to add your created ftp credentials to the GitHub repository.
   1. Log into your GitHub account, select your repository and go to the "Settings" tab.
   2. Select "Secrets and variables" from the left sidebar and click on "Actions".
   3. Click on the "New repository secret" button.
   4. Enter a name for the secret (e.g.: FTP_USERNAME) and enter the FTP username you chose in Plesk earlier as the value.
   5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add another secret for the FTP password (e.g.: FTP_PASSWORD).

# Step 2 - Create a deployment workflow
1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab.
2. Click on the "Set up a workflow yourself" link
3. Enter the following code into the text field:
```yaml
name: FTP Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Deploy over FTP
        uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@3.2.0
        with:
          server: -server-
          username: ${{ secrets.FTP_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
          server-dir: /path/to/destination/folder
          local-dir: ./path/to/local/folder
```
7. Replace "-server-" with your server adress (e.g.: hostingxxxxxx.aexxx.netcup.net, myserver.com)
5. Replace /path/to/destination/folder with the path to the folder on your server you chose to deploy the web app.
6. Replace ./path/to/local/folder with the local path of the folder containing your web app files in the GitHub repository.
8. Click on "Commit changes...", choose a commit message and click on "Commit changes".

# Step 3 - Test the created GitHub Action
1. Push changes to the main branch of your Repository to test the newly created workflow.
2. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository. The workflow should have started automatically.
3. Once the workflow is completed, go back to your Plesk panel and click on "Files" in the sidebar.
4. Go to the path you specified in the workflow.
5. You should now see the changes you made to the repository in the right folder.

# Conclusion
You now have successfully set up an automatic deployment workflow using GitHub Actions. Now, whenever you make changes to your web app's repository and push them to the main branch, the deployment workflow will run automatically, pushing the updated files to your server over ftp. Now deploying your webapp will be much less time consuming, because you won't need to log in and move over the files manually any longer.

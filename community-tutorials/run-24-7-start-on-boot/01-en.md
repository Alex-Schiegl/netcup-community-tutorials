# Introduction
This tutorial will show you, how to run something 24/7 and start it on boot Debian and Ubuntu servers <br>
For this, i will use as example a python script <br>
I am doing this on a debian 11 server (Netcup RS 2000), but it also should work on other debian versions and ubunt 

# Requirements
You need a Debian or Ubuntu Server with an Internet Connection <br>
You also need root permissions on your server.

# Step 1 - Installing Cron
First you need to connect to your server over ssh. <br>
Then we are going to switch to the root user and are going to update the system, and then we are going to install Cron (and python)
```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install wget curl sudo nano python-pip-whl cron python3 python3-pip screen -y
```

## Step 1.1 - Starting
In may example i have a python script in /home/python, which is named run.py and i want to start it on boot and it should run 24/7 <br>
First I go in the folder and install my python requirements that i need for the script
```sh
cd /home/python
pip3 install py-cord py-cord[voice]
```
Then I am going to start it (Replace `discord-py-bot` with a name and `python3 run.py` with the command to start)
```sh
screen -AmdS discord-py-bot python3 run.py
```

### Step 1.1.1 - watch console - Optional
If you want to see the output of the console run (Replace `discord-py-bot` with the name you set in Step 1.1)
```sh
screen -r discord-py-bot
```
If your want to go back to your normal console simply press `ctrl + a` and then `ctrl + d`

## Step 1.2 - start on boot
If you want to start it on boot run: (Replace `screen -AmdS discord-py-bot python3 run.py` with the entire start command of Setp 1.1 and `/home/python` with the folder path of your file)
```sh
{ crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot sleep 10 && cd /home/python && screen -AmdS discord-py-bot python3 run.py" ; } | crontab -
```

### Step 1.2.1 - test it
If you want to test if this works reboot your server
```sh
reboot
```
And after it is rebooted, test if you can see the console (Replace `discord-py-bot` with the name you set in Step 1.1)
```sh
screen -r discord-py-bot
```
If your want to go back to your normal console simply press `ctrl + a` and then `ctrl + d`

# Conclusion
Now you have set up a FTP Server. <br>

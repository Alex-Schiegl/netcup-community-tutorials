# Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to run "something" (e.g. a file or a script) 24/7 on Debian and Ubuntu servers and start it on boot.<br>
For the task described in this tutorial, I will use a Python script.<br>
I am doing this on a Debian 11 server (netcup RS 2000), but other Debian versions and Ubuntu should also work.

# Requirements

You need a Debian or Ubuntu server with an internet connection. <br>
You also need root permissions on your server.

# Step 1 - Installing Cron and Python

First you need to connect to your server via SSH.<br>
Then switch to the root user and update your system, followed by the installation of Cron and Python:

```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install wget curl sudo nano python-pip-whl cron python3 python3-pip screen -y
```

## Step 1.1 - Starting script

In my example I use a Python script in `/home/python` which is named `run.py`. I want to start it on boot and it should run 24/7.<br>
First, I switch into the folder and install the Python requirements that I need for the script:

```sh
cd /home/python
pip3 install py-cord py-cord[voice]
```

Then I proceed to start the script (replace `discord-py-bot` with a name and `python3 run.py` with the command to start):

```sh
screen -AmdS discord-py-bot python3 run.py
```

We use Gnu Screen to keep the script running even if the SSH connection is closed.

### Step 1.1.1 - Watch console (optional)

If you want to see the output of the console, run the following command (replace `discord-py-bot` with the name you defined in Step 1.1):

```sh
screen -r discord-py-bot
```

If you want to return to your normal console, press `CTRL + A` and then `CTRL + D`.

## Step 1.2 - Setting up "start on boot"

If you want the file to start on boot, run the following command (replace `screen -AmdS discord-py-bot python3 run.py` with the entire start command of Step 1.1 and `/home/python` with the folder path of your file):

```sh
{ crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot sleep 10 && cd /home/python && screen -AmdS discord-py-bot python3 run.py" ; } | crontab -
```

### Step 1.2.1 - Testing your setup

If you want to test whether your setup works, reboot your server:

```sh
reboot
```

After rebooting, check if you can see the console (replace `discord-py-bot` with the name you defined in Step 1.1):

```sh
screen -r discord-py-bot
```

# Conclusion

Now, every time you reboot your server, the file (in our example, the Python file) is also started and executed in the background.

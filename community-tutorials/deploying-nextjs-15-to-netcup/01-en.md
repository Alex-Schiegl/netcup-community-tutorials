# Introduction
This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Next.js 15+ application on Netcup Webhosting, using a custom server.js file and Node.js support provided through the Plesk interface.

You‚Äôll go through the full process: setting up your Next.js project with a standalone server, preparing your hosting environment, uploading the files, and configuring everything inside the Netcup panel.

If you're working with a shared hosting plan and want to run a custom Node.js app without switching to a VPS, this guide will help you make it work step by step. The screenshots are based on my own setup, so paths and names might include ‚Äúschiegl-connect‚Äù ‚Äî just replace them with your own values as needed.

# Requirements
* you have your nextjs app running locally on your node environment
* have a Webhosting account on Netcup
* Remind throughout the complete tutorial, to use your own paths. I intentionally added my schiegl-custom paths in screenshots etc, so that you can understand the connecting-parts easier. 

# Step 1 - Make you base setup right of nextjs
![base-structure](./images/base-structure-repo.png)

You need an own server.js and NOT the native next.js launcher in node_modules/.bin/next

## 1. Create a server.js:
```javascript
const next = require('next');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const app = next({ dev: false }); // Important for production
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

// Get LAN IP address
function getLocalExternalIP() {
    const interfaces = os.networkInterfaces();
    for (const name of Object.keys(interfaces)) {
        for (const iface of interfaces[name]) {
            if (iface.family === 'IPv4' && !iface.internal) {
                return iface.address;
            }
        }
    }
    return 'localhost';
}

app.prepare().then(() => {
    http.createServer((req, res) => {
        handle(req, res);
    }).listen(port, () => {
        const localURL = `http://localhost:${port}`;
        const lanURL = `http://${getLocalExternalIP()}:${port}`;

        console.log('üöÄ Server is running!');
        console.log(`üîó Local:  \x1b[36m${localURL}\x1b[0m`);
        console.log(`üåê LAN:    \x1b[36m${lanURL}\x1b[0m`);
        console.log('‚úÖ Ready to serve!');
    });
});
```

## 2. enhance package.json
I needed to change the content of "scripts" to:
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node server.js",
    "build": "next build",
    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
```

## 3. install cross-env
```bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env
```
in order to be able to run 'npm start' from your dev-Windows machine, if you have one AND it works with Phusion (which is the node.js handler at Netcup). 

Test locally to run: 
- on Windows: $env:PORT=4001; npm start
- on Linux: PORT=4001 npm start   (<- not tested, ChatGPT generated)

If it works on your dev-machine, go on.
It should look like that:
![happy-local-setup](./images/happy-local-setup.png)

Yes, and test your application, if still everything works üòâ 

# Step 2 - Add Subdomain (if needed)
If you need a subdomain, add it now.
![subdomain](./images/add-subdomain.png)
If not, just make sure you have a default-setting for the page we configure now.
You do not need to change the document root, as we delete it anyways.

# Step 3 - Setup SSL and verify Default working
-> with SSL/TLS Certificates for example https://helpcenter.netcup.com/en/wiki/web-hosting/enabling-ssl-tls

Then, you should see at least that:
![apache](./images/apache-online.png)

That is the default Apache "Hi". We gonna stop that to make place for node.js. 

# Step 4 - Disable Proxy (Apache Use)
Click:
![first-nginx](./images/first_step_nginx.png)

Click:
![second-nginx](./images/second_step_nginx.png)

Now, Apache is not bothered anymore and we are ready to setup node.js

# Step 5 - Place your Code on the Webhosting
SSH connect to your server.

It should look like that now:
![ssh-1](./images/ssh-1.png)

Remove the httpdocs 
```bash
rm -rf httpdocs/
```
and add your code (via git for example, see this screenshot)
![ssh-2](./images/ssh-2.png)
It should look like in the screenshot now at your setup. So you see our server.js? Remember, this is located in the root /demo.schiegl-connect.at/.

# Step 6 - Setup Node.js in Webhosting Plesk Panel in Netcup
Go into Node Config:
![node-1](./images/node-1.png)

Change the two settings accordingly and activate Node.js (the activation takes a little bit):
![node-2](./images/node-2.png)

Do a npm install the Plesk way and wait until finished:
![node-3](./images/node-3.png)

Then do npm run build and wait until finished
![node-4](./images/node-4.png)

Change the document root to: <your_path>/.next/static (this is only possible now, AFTER the build)
![node-5](./images/node-5.png)

Now do a run start and hope üòä: 
![node-6](./images/node-6.png)

Should look like that:
![node-7](./images/node-7.png)

# Conclusion
Yes, works:

Have a nice day!

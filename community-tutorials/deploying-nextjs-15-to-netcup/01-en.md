# Introduction
Deploying modern JavaScript frameworks like Next.js 15+ can be tricky when working within the limitations of shared web hosting environments ‚Äî especially when your app includes a custom server.js. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll walk through how to deploy a production-ready Next.js 15 application to Netcup Webhosting, leveraging Node.js support and Netcup‚Äôs powerful web interface.

You‚Äôll learn how to prepare your Next.js project, configure your custom server, deploy your code via FTP or SSH, and set up your environment so your app runs smoothly under Netcup‚Äôs web hosting infrastructure.

This guide is ideal for developers with a working Next.js 15 app who want to take advantage of Netcup‚Äôs affordable and flexible hosting plans ‚Äî without spinning up a full VPS.

By the end, your app will be live on the internet, served by your very own server.js, and ready for production traffic.

# Requirements
* you have your nextjs app running locally on your node environment
* have a Webhosting account on Netcup
* Remind throughout the complete tutorial, to use your own paths. I intentionally added my schiegl-custom paths in screenshots etc, so that you can understand the connecting-parts easier. 

# Step 1 - Make you base setup right of nextjs
![base-structure](./images/base-structure-repo.png)

You need an own server.js and NOT the native next.js launcher in node_modules/.bin/next

## 1. Create a server.js:
```javascript
const next = require('next');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const app = next({ dev: false }); // Important for production
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

// Get LAN IP address
function getLocalExternalIP() {
    const interfaces = os.networkInterfaces();
    for (const name of Object.keys(interfaces)) {
        for (const iface of interfaces[name]) {
            if (iface.family === 'IPv4' && !iface.internal) {
                return iface.address;
            }
        }
    }
    return 'localhost';
}

app.prepare().then(() => {
    http.createServer((req, res) => {
        handle(req, res);
    }).listen(port, () => {
        const localURL = `http://localhost:${port}`;
        const lanURL = `http://${getLocalExternalIP()}:${port}`;

        console.log('üöÄ Server is running!');
        console.log(`üîó Local:  \x1b[36m${localURL}\x1b[0m`);
        console.log(`üåê LAN:    \x1b[36m${lanURL}\x1b[0m`);
        console.log('‚úÖ Ready to serve!');
    });
});
```

## 2. enhance package.json
I needed to change the content of "scripts" to:
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node server.js",
    "build": "next build",
    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
```

## 3. install cross-env
```bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env
```
in order to be able to run 'npm start' from your dev-Windows machine, if you have one AND it works with Phusion (which is the node.js handler at Netcup). 

Test locally to run: 
- on Windows: $env:PORT=4001; npm start
- on Linux: PORT=4001 npm start   (<- not tested, ChatGPT generated)

If it works on your dev-machine, go on.
It should look like that:
![happy-local-setup](./images/happy-local-setup.png)

Yes, and test your application, if still everything works üòâ 

# Step 2 - Add Subdomain (if needed)
If you need a subdomain, add it now.
![subdomain](./images/add-subdomain.png)
If not, just make sure you have a default-setting for the page we configure now.
You do not need to change the document root, as we delete it anyways.

# Step 3 - Setup SSL and verify Default working
-> with SSL/TLS Certificates for example https://helpcenter.netcup.com/en/wiki/web-hosting/enabling-ssl-tls

Then, you should see at least that:
![apache](./images/apache-online.png)

That is the default Apache "Hi". We gonna stop that to make place for node.js. 

# Step 4 - Disable Proxy (Apache Use)
Click:
![first-nginx](./images/first_step_nginx.png)

Click:
![second-nginx](./images/second_step_nginx.png)

Now, Apache is not bothered anymore and we are ready to setup node.js

# Step 5 - Place your Code on the Webhosting
SSH connect to your server.

It should look like that now:
![ssh-1](./images/ssh-1.png)

Remove the httpdocs 
```bash
rm -rf httpdocs/
```
and add you code (via git for example, see this screenshot)
![ssh-2](./images/ssh-2.png)
the above screenshot also says you how it should look like. So you see our server.js? Remember, this is in the root /demo.schiegl-connect.at/ located.

# Step 6 - Setup Node.js in Webhosting Plesk Panel in Netcup
Go into Node Config:
![node-1](./images/node-1.png)

Change the two settings accordingly and active Node.js (the activation takes a little bit):
![node-2](./images/node-2.png)

Do a npm install the Plesk way and wait until finished:
![node-3](./images/node-3.png)

Then do npm run build and wait until finished
![node-4](./images/node-4.png)

Change the document root to: <your_path>/.next/static (this is only now possible, AFTER the build)
![node-5](./images/node-5.png)

Now do a run start and hope üòä: 
![node-6](./images/node-6.png)

Should look like that:
![node-7](./images/node-7.png)

# Conclusion
Yes, works:

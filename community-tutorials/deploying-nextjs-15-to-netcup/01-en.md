# Introduction
Deploying modern JavaScript frameworks like Next.js 15+ can be tricky when working within the limitations of shared web hosting environments — especially when your app includes a custom server.js. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to deploy a production-ready Next.js 15 application to Netcup Webhosting, leveraging Node.js support and Netcup’s powerful web interface.

You’ll learn how to prepare your Next.js project, configure your custom server, deploy your code via FTP or SSH, and set up your environment so your app runs smoothly under Netcup’s web hosting infrastructure.

This guide is ideal for developers with a working Next.js 15 app who want to take advantage of Netcup’s affordable and flexible hosting plans — without spinning up a full VPS.

By the end, your app will be live on the internet, served by your very own server.js, and ready for production traffic.

# Requirements
* you have your nextjs app running locally on your node environment
* have a Webhosting account on Netcup

# Step 1 - Make you base setup right of nextjs
![base-structure](./images/base-structure-repo.png)

You need an own server.js and NOT the native next.js launcher in node_modules/.bin/next

So, create a server.js:
```javascript
const next = require('next');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const app = next({ dev: false }); // Important for production
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

// Get LAN IP address
function getLocalExternalIP() {
    const interfaces = os.networkInterfaces();
    for (const name of Object.keys(interfaces)) {
        for (const iface of interfaces[name]) {
            if (iface.family === 'IPv4' && !iface.internal) {
                return iface.address;
            }
        }
    }
    return 'localhost';
}

app.prepare().then(() => {
    http.createServer((req, res) => {
        handle(req, res);
    }).listen(port, () => {
        const localURL = `http://localhost:${port}`;
        const lanURL = `http://${getLocalExternalIP()}:${port}`;

        console.log('🚀 Server is running!');
        console.log(`🔗 Local:  \x1b[36m${localURL}\x1b[0m`);
        console.log(`🌐 LAN:    \x1b[36m${lanURL}\x1b[0m`);
        console.log('✅ Ready to serve!');
    });
});
```

# Step 2 - Basic configuration of the server
After provisioning of the server and the first login with the username `root` and the password sent by email, the first step is to update the basic configuration of the server.

1. Change the root password by means of `passwd`.
2. Import the current security updates with `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y`.
3. It is recommended to set up an SSH key at this point and to disallow password login for the root user. These procedures are not part of this tutorial and as the latter functionality requires root capability, the setup of an unprivileged user is omitted at this point.

# Step 3 - Configuration of SSH daemon

> **Info**
> Note that the SSH daemon usually listens on port 22.

To make it accessible even from restricted networks, it is configured to listen also on ports 443 (HTTPS) and 80 (HTTP). These ports are usually less restricted or not restricted at all, so there is a good chance that they can be used to gain free access to the proxy and thus to the internet.

1. Open the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` in an editor like `vi` or `nano`.
2. Search for the line `port 22`. It probably starts with a `#` to indicate that this is the basic configuration.
3. Change the file to:
   ```
   port 22 
   port 80 
   port 443 
   ```
4. Save and exit the editor.
5. Restart SSH daemon with `systemctl restart ssh`. The current session should remain active.
6. Use `ssh -p 443 root@v11111111.quicksrv.de` to test if the configuration was set up successfully.
   Please replace `v11111111.quicksrv.de` with your own hostname.

SSH daemon is now successfully configured and can be reached via ports 22, 80 and 443.

# Step 4 - Use as SOCKS server
To use Chrome or another browser in such a way that it handles all traffic through the SSH proxy, you use it as a SOCKS proxy. This way, you can show streaming services, for example, that you are actually located in Germany if the geolocation of your own IP doesn't work properly.

Technically, in this case, your own computer is the SOCKS proxy that uses SSH proxy for forwarding. Therefore, `localhost` is specified as the (SOCKS) proxy server (see figure below).

Start an SSH session on your own computer with the following command:

`ssh -p 443 -D8080 -N root@v11111111.quicksrv.de`. Replace the example `v11111111.quicksrv.de` with the correct server name.

Then start Chrome in a second window with the following command:

`google-chrome --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:8080" --host-resolver-rules="MAP * ~NOTFOUND , EXCLUDE localhost"`.

This results in Chrome using the SOCKS proxy as nameserver for name resolution, which protects your privacy.

# Step 5 - Use as jump server
To access other servers whose SSH daemon is bound only to port 22 (or another), use the command:

`ssh -J root@v11111111.quicksrv.de:443 root@myserver.com`

Replace our example `v11111111.quicksrv.de` with the correct proxy server name. Instead of `myserver.com` you must specify the server to which you want to connect through the proxy.

# Conclusion
SSH proxy can now be used. It is recommended to perform tests before productive use.

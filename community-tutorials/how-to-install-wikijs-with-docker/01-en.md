# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing wiki.js using Docker Compose. By the end, you'll have a fully functional wiki.js instance running in a Docker container.

The tutorial uses the example hostname `v11111111.quicksrv.de`. This hostname needs to be replaced by the name of your own server when you perform the workflow described in this tutorial.

# Requirements

- A linux server 
- Basic understanding of shell commands.
- The simplest VPS from netcup meets these requirements 


# Step 1 - Install Docker Compose
If you haven't installed Docker and Docker Compose on your server, use the following commands:
```bash
# Install Docker Compose
apt install docker-compose
```
# Step 2 - Create a Docker Compose file for wiki.js
Create a new directory for your wiki.js setup and navigate into it:
```bash
mkdir wikijs && cd wikijs
```
Now, create a `docker-compose.yml` file using your favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`):
```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:11-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: wiki
      POSTGRES_USER: wikijs
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: wikijsrocks
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  wiki:
    image: requarks/wiki:2
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      DB_TYPE: postgres
      DB_HOST: db
      DB_PORT: 5432
      DB_USER: wikijs
      DB_PASS: wikijsrocks
      DB_NAME: wiki
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
volumes:
  db-data:
```

In this configuration:

- We define environmental variables to configure the PostgreSQL database.
- We map port 3000 inside the wiki container to port 80 on the host, making our wiki.js instance accessible at http://v11111111.quicksrv.de.
- `environment`: A list of environment variables set within the container.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The name of the database to be created.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: The username for the database.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.
- **Note**: You should replace the password `wikijsrocks` with a secure password of your choice.
- `DB_TYPE`: Type of the database, here `postgres`.
- `DB_HOST`: Hostname of the database. Since the database is within the same Docker network, we use the service name `db`.
- `DB_PORT`: Port of the database, default is `5432` for PostgreSQL.
- `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS`: Credentials to access the database. These should match the environment variables of the `db` service.
- `DB_NAME`: Name of the database to be used.
- `ports`: Determines which ports are forwarded from the host to the container.
  - `80:3000`: Forwards port 80 of the host to port 3000 inside the container.

When using this Docker Compose file, at a minimum, you should replace the database password with a secure password of your choice. All other configurations can be adjusted based on your requirements and infrastructure.



# Step 3 - Start the wiki.js containers
Now, run the following command to start the wiki.js and its database containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This command will download the necessary images and start the containers in detached mode.
# Step 4 - Access the wiki.js installation
Once the containers are up and running, open your web browser and navigate to your server's address, e.g., http://v11111111.quicksrv.de. You should see the wiki.js setup wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully installed wiki.js using Docker Compose. Now you can start creating and organizing your documentation or knowledge base with ease. Remember to regularly backup your data and keep your software up to date for security reasons.

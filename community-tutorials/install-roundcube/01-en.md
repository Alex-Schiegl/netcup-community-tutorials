# Introduction
This tutorial describes how to set up [Roundcube](https://roundcube.net/) as a webmail frontend for your emails using a sqlite file backend with the netcup IMAP and SMTP server.

netcup is already providing at least one Roundcube webmail instance [https://webmail01.netcup.net/] and for each domain example.com with DNS A record `webmail.example.com`

But in case you want to use a newer Roundcube version or customize your installation it might be better to directly install this on your own webhosting which also allows you to also setup a Let's Encrypt certificate. Another benefit is the use of the Dark Mode which is available since Roundcube version 1.5.0.

The reading time of this tutorial is about five minutes. The implementation will take approximately 20 minutes.

The most important requirement for implementation is a basic understanding of SSH and the Unix command line and a netcup webhosting package.

The tutorial uses the example domain `example.com`. This hostname needs to be replaced by the name of your own domain name when you perform the steps described in this tutorial.

# Requirements
The installation could also be performed on any VPS but this tutorial focuses on a default webhosting setup:

* Webhosting 1000 or better
* a (sub) domain

# Step 1 - Adding the subdomain and get the document root
Adding a subdomain is easy using the WCP [Add Subdomain] button in the webhosting interface "Websites & Domains".

![WCP (plesk) adding a subdomain](images/netcup_wcp_add_subdomain.png)

We are using the following subdomain: wm.example.com

Now we are gathering some information about the webhosting that we need later during the configuration.

Navigate to the WCP "PHP Settings" of the new subdomain and note down the current value of the {DOCROOT} e.g.

`/var/www/vhosts/hosting123456.a1b2c.netcup.net/wm.example.com/httpdocs`

In the "SSL/TLS Certificates" settings of the new subdomain, you can add a recommended SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt.

# Step 2 - Download Roundcube and mime.types via SSH
Downloading the Roundcube release from the Roundcube Download page: [https://roundcube.net/download/]

We are using the stable release 1.5.2 complete package for this tutorial and connect to the webhost using SSH.

Connect via SSH to your webhost using the details in the "Web Hosting Access" section of the subdomain.

Navigate to the document root:
`cd wm.example.com/httpdocs/`

Delete the favicon.ico and index.html which were created during the add subdomain step:
`rm favicon.ico index.html`

Download the complete package in tar.gz format:
`wget https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/download/1.5.2/roundcubemail-1.5.2-complete.tar.gz`

Extract the tar.gz package stripping the subdirectory 'roundcubemail-1.5.2':
`tar xzvfs roundcubemail-1.5.2-complete.tar.gz --strip-components=1`

Download a mime.types definition from the Apache project:
`wget http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types`


# Step 3 - Configuring Roundcube installation with a few fixed settings
Typically a configuration is created copying from the sample and filling additional setting from the defaults file.

If you feel insecure editing the files with an editor go directly to the next stage or modify the files locally and transfer e.g. via FTP.

Copy from sample configuration:
`cp config/config.inc.php.sample config/config.inc.php`

Configuring the installation editing the config.inc.php file using your favorite editor. We will be using nano for this instruction.
`nano config/config.inc.php`

Replacing some configuration options but minimum the following ones:
- db_dsnw
- default_host
- des_key
- language
- mime_types
- smtp_conn_options
- smtp_server


A full sample configuration that could be used after replacing the document roots in db_dsnw, mime_types and filling a new 24 character long des_key:
```
<?php

/* Local configuration for Roundcube Webmail using netcup SMTP and IMAP server*/

// Database connection string (DSN) for read+write operations
// Currently supported db_providers: mysql, pgsql, sqlite, mssql, sqlsrv, oracle
// NOTE: for SQLite use absolute path (Linux): 'sqlite:////full/path/to/sqlite.db?mode=0646'
$config['db_dsnw'] = 'sqlite:////var/www/vhosts/hosting123456.a1b2c.netcup.net/wm.example.com/httpdocs/config/sqllite.db?mode=0646';

// The netcup IMAP host chosen to perform the log-in.
$config['default_host'] = 'mail.example.com';

// Setup the default IMAP Port for SSL
$config['default_port'] = 993;

// workaround for netcup IMAP server requiring SSL
// but the certificate does not match the server name mail.example.com
$config['imap_conn_options'] = [
  'ssl' =>
  [
    'verify_peer' => false,
    'verify_peer_name' => false,
    'allow_self_signed' => false,
    'verify_depth' => 3,
    'cafile' => '/etc/openssl/certs/ca.crt',
  ],
];

// netcup SMTP server host (for sending mails) using STARTTLS
$config['smtp_server'] = 'tls://mail.example.com';

// workaround for netcup SMTP server requiring STARTTLS
// but the certificate not match the server name mail.example.com
$config['smtp_conn_options'] = [
  'ssl' =>
  [
     'verify_peer' => false,
     'verify_peer_name' => false,
     'allow_self_signed' => false,
     'verify_depth' => 3,
     'cafile' => '/etc/openssl/certs/ca.crt',
  ],
];

// provide an URL where a user can get support for this Roundcube installation
// (not linking to the Roundcube site itself and instead giving the webmaster address)
$config['support_url'] = 'mailto:webmaster@example.com';

// This key is used to encrypt the users imap password which is stored
// in the session record. For the default cipher method it must be
// exactly 24 characters long.
// YOUR KEY MUST BE DIFFERENT THAN THE SAMPLE VALUE FOR SECURITY REASONS
$config['des_key'] = 'rcmail-!24ByteDESkey*Str';

// Specifying the username_domain allows to login with username
// without having to specify the domain
$config['username_domain'] = 'example.com';

// the mime type definition
$config['mime_types'] = '/var/www/vhosts/hosting123456.a1b2c.netcup.net/wm.example.com/httpdocs/mime.types';

// List of active plugins in plugins/ directory (copied from netcup instance adding markasjunk and zipdownload)
$config['plugins'] = ['filesystem_attachments', 'jqueryui', 'managesieve', 'markasjunk', 'zipdownload'];

// default language is set to German (Germany)
$config['language'] = 'de_DE';

// enable the spellchecker
$config['enable_spellcheck'] = true;

// in case you want to use the installer again uncomment this
$config['enable_installer'] = true;

```


# Step 4 - Run setup in browser
After the basic configuration the web installer can be run to make additional settings and verify the installation works.
Also configuration is cleaned and reformatted and random keys set e.g. for des_key.

Just open the installer URL in a browser of your choice: https://wm.example.com/installer/index.php

## Check environment

The first "Check environment" step should be already OK because everything is available in the netcup webhosting environment.

Click [NEXT] and continue to the "Create config"

## Create config

If you want you can configure the `support_url` with an E-Mail address like `webmaster@example.com`

You can enable a spell checker from Google setting `enable_spellcheck` to `Google`

Enter the Database settings and start with `Database type` `SQLite` and remove all other entries except for the Database name where we add the absolute URL SQLite database file in:

`/var/www/vhosts/hosting123456.a1b2c.netcup.net/wm.example.com/httpdocs/config/sqllite.db`

Set the `default_host` to the Netcup IMAP Host of your webhosting `ssl://mail.example.com`

If you want the `username_domain` can be specified to be added to the username automatically.

Then also set the `smtp_server` to `tls://mail.example.com`.

Configure the language to German setting `language` to `de_DE` or any other locale you want.

This completes this stage in the configuration.

Click [NEXT] and continue to the "Test config" after the configuration save was displayed using [CONTINUE].

## Test config

Here the [Send test mail] and [Check login] can be used to test the IMAP login and SMTP mail sending.

# Step 5 - Finish and secure installation
Comment the installer enabling line or delete it from `config/config.inc.php`:
`$config['enable_installer'] = true;`

Remove installer folder from webspace from your SSH session or via FTP.
`rm -rf installer`

If you do not want to keep the release tar.gz delete it:
`rm roundcubemail-1.5.2-complete.tar.gz`

If you have put the sqllite database file in a different folder that is not protected by the `.htaccess` file of the Roundcube installation make sure to add it to the `.htaccess` file to protect it from being downloaded.


# Step 6 - Login and test
To access the webmail instance just opening `https://wm.example.com` should work now and login in is already a good test.


# Step 7 - Enhancements and Updates
Other Plugins can be activated by adding them to the `$config['plugins']` item in the `config/config.inc.php` file.

If you want to use your own roundcube installation for different mail hosts, just remove the config option for `username_domain` and change the options for `default_host` and `smtp_server`:

```
$config['default_host'] = [
    'ssl://mail.example.com' => 'netcup (example.com)',
    'ssl://imap.gmail.com' => 'Gmail',
    'ssl://imap.web.de' => 'WEB.DE',
    'ssl://imap.gmx.net' => 'GMX',
    'ssl://mx.freenet.de' => 'freenet.de',
    'ssl://outlook.office365.com' => 'Outlook.com',
    'ssl://imap.mail.me.com' => 'iCloud',
    'ssl://secureimap.t-online.de' => 't-online.de',
    'ssl://imap.mail.yahoo.com' => 'Yahoo!',
    'ssl://imap.mail.de' => 'mail.de',
];

$config['smtp_server'] = [
    'mail.example.com' => 'tls://mail.example.com',
    'imap.gmail.com' => 'tls://smtp.gmail.com',
    'imap.web.de' => 'tls://smtp.web.de',
    'imap.gmx.net' => 'tls://mail.gmx.net',
    'mx.freenet.de' => 'tls://mx.freenet.de',
    'outlook.office365.com' => 'tls://smtp-mail.outlook.com',
    'imap.mail.me.com' => 'tls://smtp.mail.me.com',
    'secureimap.t-online.de' => 'tls://securesmtp.t-online.de',
    'imap.mail.yahoo.com' => 'tls://smtp.mail.yahoo.com',
    'imap.mail.de' => 'tls://smtp.mail.de',
];
```


# Conclusion
The webmail instance can now be used. It is recommended to perform some tests before productive use.

If the Dark Mode is enabled the login page with the default Elastic theme looks like this:

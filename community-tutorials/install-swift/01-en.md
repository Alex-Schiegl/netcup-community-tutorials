# Introduction

This tutorial explains how to install Swift 5.8 or later in Ubuntu 20.04.


# Requirements

Deploying Swift and needing to compile a small project requires at least the following requirements:

* 2GM RAM +
* 4 Core CPU

Hard disk capacity doesn't matter, all netcup's machines can accommodate it.


# Step 1 - Ordering the VPS

At the time of the creation of this tutorial (Aug 2023), the recommended product to be used as Swift is [RS 2000 G9.5](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2894). 

Existing customers can add the product easily and quickly.


# Step 2 - Defining Swift-related environments

In August 2023, we are using Swift 5.8.

Execute in order:

```bash
export SWIFT_VERSION=5.8
export SWIFT_VERSION_NAME=swift-$SWIFT_VERSION
export UBUNTU_VERSION=ubuntu20.04
export UBUNTU_VERSION_SHORT=ubuntu2004
export SWIFT_DOWNLOAD_URL="https://download.swift.org/${SWIFT_VERSION_NAME}-release/${UBUNTU_VERSION_SHORT}/${SWIFT_VERSION_NAME}-RELEASE/${SWIFT_VERSION_NAME}-RELEASE-${UBUNTU_VERSION}.tar.gz"
```

Once that's done, let's make sure it's taken effect:
`echo $SWIFT_DOWNLOAD_URL`

If the following is output, the environment variable configuration has taken effect:
`https://download.swift.org/swift-5.8-release/ubuntu2004/swift-5.8-RELEASE/swift-5.8-RELEASE-ubuntu20.04.tar.gz` 


# Step 3 - Installation of dependent components

We're currently using the Swift 5.8 dependencies, so if you're not using the same version I am, see below (Step 3.1) for how to find the dependencies

```bash
/bin/sh -c export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive DEBCONF_NONINTERACTIVE_SEEN=true && apt-get -q update && \
    apt-get -q install -y \
    binutils \
    git \
    unzip \
    gnupg2 \
    libc6-dev \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev \
    libedit2 \
    libgcc-9-dev \
    libpython3.8 \
    libsqlite3-0 \
    libstdc++-9-dev \
    libxml2-dev \
    libz3-dev \
    pkg-config \
    tzdata \
    zlib1g-dev \
    && rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### Step 3.1 - How to Find Dependencies

Swift provides official source code for Dockerfile. [Swift Dockerfile Content](https://github.com/apple/swift-docker/blob/0190ac8d812bfcfab0ee39d600116ab5e3243f48/5.8/ubuntu/20.04/Dockerfile)

We will extract the dependencies in Dockerfile:

![How to find dependencies](images/swift-docker.png)

Since it's what Docker needs, we need to make a simple modification when we use:

‼️ Just replace `RUN export` with `/bin/sh -c export` and leave the rest.

# Step 4 - Install Swift and Verify

Once the dependencies are installed, we begin the Swift installation.

```bash
wget -O swift.tar.gz $SWIFT_DOWNLOAD_URL \
    && tar -xzf swift.tar.gz --directory / --strip-components=1 \
    && chmod -R o+r /usr/lib/swift \
    && rm swift.tar.gz
```

This downloads the Swift archive from $SWIFT_DOWNLOAD_URL and extracts it to the current directory.

Then add executable permissions to the Swift executable file,
 
Finally, the downloaded tarball, `swift.tar.gz`, is removed to free up space.

Let's confirm that the installation was successful by running
`swift --version`

If you output the following, we have successfully installed 🎉
```bash
Swift version 5.8 (swift-5.8-RELEASE)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```


# End - Quick Installation

Finally, we've provided the whole thing so you can quickly install Swift with a single click by simply modifying it and saving it as a sh file!

What needs to be changed:

* `SWIFT_VERSION` to the version you need to install.

* `/bin/sh -c export` Changes to the corresponding version of the dependency library, see `Step 3.1 - How to Find Dependencies`.

Finally, save the whole thing as `install-swift.sh` and run `bash install-swift.sh` to do so.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

SWIFT_VERSION=5.8

if which swift > /dev/null; then
    if swift --version | grep -q "$SWIFT_VERSION"; then
        echo "Swift version $SWIFT_VERSION is installed."
        exit 0
    else
        read -p "Swift is installed, but it is not $SWIFT_VERSION, should upgrade? [y/n]" upgrade
        
        case $upgrade in
            "y")
                echo "upgrade to $SWIFT_VERSION"
                ;;
            "n")
                echo "keep version"
                exit 0
                ;;
            *)
                echo "keep version"
                exit 0
                ;;
        esac
    fi
fi

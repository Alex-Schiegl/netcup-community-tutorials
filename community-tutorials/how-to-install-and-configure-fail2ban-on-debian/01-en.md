# Introduction
This tutotiral is about how to install and configure fail2ban on a debian linux system. If an ip address has to many ssh login failures, fail2ban will block this ip address for a specific ban time.

# Requirements
First you need the package manager apt. You need also an editor, for example vi or nano, to create and change config files.

# Step 1 - Install fail2ban with package manager apt
All commands are executed with sudo, because root-permissions are needed.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```

# Step 2 - Copy the default-config file to new location
fail2ban has two configuration files: /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf and /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/defaults-debian.conf.
You should not update these files, because they may be overwritten when the package is updated.
The recommended way is to create a .local file, which overrides the settings from the .conf file.
```sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local```

# Step 3 - Change the [DEFAULT] section and add this configuration
Open the configuration file ```/etc/fail2ban/jail.local``` with vi or nano.
Change the section [DEFAULT] to this configuration:
```
[DEFAULT]
# "ignoreip" can be a list of IP addresses, CIDR masks or DNS hosts. Fail2ban
# will not ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses
# can be defined using space (and/or comma) separator.
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1
# "bantime" is the number of seconds that a host is banned.
bantime  = 3600
# A host is banned if it has generated "maxretry" during the last "findtime"
# seconds.
findtime = 600
# "maxretry" is the number of failures before a host get banned.
maxretry = 5
```

Save the configuration file.

# Step 4 - Enable sshd in the [sshd]-section in the configuration file
Open the configuration file ```/etc/fail2ban/jail.local``` with vi or nano.
Search for the [sshd]-section:
```
#
# SSH servers
#

[sshd]
```

add the enabled after the [sshd]:

```
#
# SSH servers
#

[sshd]
enabled = true
```

With this we enable sshd for fail2ban to watch the logpath for authentication errors.
Save the configuration file.

# Step 5 - Optional: E-Mail Notifications are possible

You can also configure E-Mail-Notifications in the file ```/etc/fail2ban/jail.local```, but this is optional.
In this case you have to change the [DEFAULT]-Section:

```
[DEFAULT]
# ...
action = %(action_mw)s
destemail = admin@your-special-netcup-domain.net
sender = root@your-special-netcup-domain.net
```

# Step 6 - Restart the service fail2ban
```sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart```

# Step 7 - Check the status of the service fail2ban
```sudo service fail2ban status```

# Conclusion
You learned how to install and configure fail2ban. Fail2ban supports not only sshd. It also supports databases, mailservers and webservers.

# Introduction
This tutorial is about how to generate a self-signed certificate and use it with a nginx webserver on a debian linux system. The self-signed certificate will be 365 days valid. To run a nginx, we use a helpful tool, which is docker. In the docker container we will mount the configuration-file and the generated public-key-pair-files.

# Requirements
First you need a virtual server with debian or ubuntu from netcup. This tutorial requires also the setup of docker. On the netcup-community-tutorials you find another tutorial how to setup docker on ubuntu.

# Step 1 - First check your docker version
Check the docker version:
```
sudo docker -v
```
Output should look like this, maybe the version and build can be different:
```
Docker version 20.10.10, build b485636
```

# Step 2 - Install openssl and curl
Run the following command to install openssl and curl:
```
sudo apt-get install openssl curl
```

# Step 3 - Creating the SSL Certificate with openssl
Create the self-signed certificate:
```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out public.crt -keyout private.key
```

You have to answer some questions on the command-line to the certificate, for example information about your website or information about your organization. Normally a self-signed certificate would be used for a private use-case, so the information is not so important.

You can enter for example this values and press enter after every answer:
```
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:DE
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Berlin
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Berlin
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Test Company Name
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Test Organisation Unit
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:your-netcup-domain.net
Email Address []:test-email-address@your-netcup-domain.net
```

In the next lines you find a description of all the OpenSSL options, which are used in this command.

* -newkey rsa:4096: Create a 4096 bit RSA key, which is used for the certificate. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is the cryptography algorithm and 4096 the generated key size in bit.

* -x509: Create a self-signed certificate.

* -sha256: Request of the certificate generation using 265-bit SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)

* -days: Defines how many days the certificate is valid. In the case of a self-signed certificate, this value can be very low or very high.

* -nodes: Don't require a passphrase. If you remove this option, you have to enter the passphrase in the commandline each time the application starts.

# Step 4 - Create a file with static content

Create a file index.html in the current directory with a texteditor:
```
vi index.html
```

Insert the following:
```
<html>
<head></head>
<body>Hello World!</body>
</html>
```

Save the file.

# Step 5 - Create the nginx configuration with SSL

Create the configuration file default.conf with a texteditor in the current directory:
```
vi default.conf
```

Insert the following:
```
server {
   listen 443 ssl;
   server_name _;

   ssl_certificate /etc/certs/public.crt;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/certs/private.key;

   location / {
      root /usr/share/nginx/html;
   }
}
```

Save the configuration file.

# Step 6 - Start a container with nginx

This command will create a new container of the baseimage nginx:1.21.4 and will mount different volumes in the container. If the baseimage doesn't exists in the local registry, docker will first pull the image.
Run the following command to start a new container with the name nginx:

```
docker run -d --name nginx \
    -p 443:443 \
    -v $(pwd)/public.crt:/etc/certs/public.crt \
    -v $(pwd)/private.key:/etc/certs/private.key \
    -v $(pwd)/index.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html \
    -v $(pwd)/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf nginx:1.21.4
```

# Step 7 - Test the webserver with curl
Run the command in the command-line:
```
curl --insecure https://localhost:443
```

The output should be:
```
<html>
<head></head>
<body>Hello World!</body>
</html>
```

# Step 8 - Test the webserver with your browser
Open you browser and enter the url, but don't forget to change the ip-address: ```https://<ip-address-of-your-netcup-server>:443```.

Youre browser will show a warning page, that the certificate is trusted. Click on "Expanded" and then on "Accept risk and continue", to accept the warning.

Now you should see the message "Hello World!".

# Step 9 - Cleanup the container and remove all files
```
sudo docker stop nginx
sudo docker rm nginx
rm public.crt
rm private.key
rm index.html
rm default.conf
```

# Conclusion
You learned how to generate a self-signed certificate and how to configure a nginx to use the generated public-key-pair. You also learned how to start a nginx in a docker container and mount different files in the container. Self-signed certificates can be valid for a very long time-period, for example more than one year. You can specify the number of days on the command-line.

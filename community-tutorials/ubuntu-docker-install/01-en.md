# Introduction
This tutorial explains how to install Docker-CE on Ubuntu 20.04.
With this tutorial you will learn how to install and configure Docker on Ubuntu to use it with many different apps and services.
In addition this tutorial describes how to use Docker with **ufw** and additionally install and setup **docker-compose** and **portainer**.
You should have a basic understanding of linux and shell commands. A fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04 (may work with other versions too) is required.

This tutorial is based on the [offical tutorial provided by docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) with a few extra notes and additions.

# Requirements
Docker can be used on nearly any Root- or V-Server. Netcups server's architecture is amd64. You need to be root and/or have sudo privileges to install packages.

# Step 1 - (Preparation)
We will install Docker by using Ubuntus APT package manager. To fetch the latest package database, use:
```bash
    sudo apt-get update
```

To add a custom package repository for docker we need a few apt-tools which might not be already present. Use the following command to install them:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

If there are multiple packages or dependencies to be installed, the installer might ask for your confirmation. Press ``y`` and ENTER when asked:

```
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  ....
0 upgraded, 64 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 13.5 MB of archives.
After this operation, 51.6 MB of additional disk space will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y
```


# Step 2 - (Add custom repository and install docker)


## Step 2.1 - (Add custom apt repository)
Docker gets shipped by a custom apt package repository hosted by docker organization. This provides newer and more frequently updated versions of docker-ce.

At first you need to add dockers PGP Key. To do this execute the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

After adding the key-file we need to add the new repository. To do this type:

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

To fetch all available packages from the newly added repository run
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

again.



## Step 2.2 - (Install Docker)
To finally install the docker package run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

## Step 2.3 - (Test if docker is working)

To test whether docker is working you can fetch the hello world image and start it by using:
```
sudo docker run --rm hello-world
```

# Step 3 - (Setup UFW to have docker not bypass firewall rules) (Optional)
If you're using ufw as an iptables frontend / firewall for your server - you should be cautious about dockers iptables modifications since docker bypasses rules defined with ufw. To fix this we have to modify a specififc UFW config file. This part is based on the [ufw-docker Github repository](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker) tutorial.

To check if your server is using UFW run 
```bash
sudo ufw status
```
and check whether the reported status is ``active``.
The expected result should be similar to this:
```
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
...                         ...         ...
```

If your server shows the inactive state, ufw is not enabled for your server. If you would like to enable it see **Step 3.1**

## Step 3.1 - (Enable UFW) (Optional)

> **Important:** When enabling ufw and not adding a rule for ssh you might loose connectivity to your server. Make sure to add an appropriate rule for allowing ssh traffic on port ``22`` by using the following command:
> ```bash
>   sudo ufw allow ssh
> ```
> You could also add this rule by using netcups web console feature found inside your server control panel.

To enable ufw in case its not yet enabled you can run:
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

## Step 3.2 - (Setup UFW Config)
Use an editor of your choice to edit the configuration file at ``/etc/ufw/after.rules`` (e.g. ``sudo nano /etc/ufw/after.rules``).
Add the following to the end of the file and save it:

```
# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER
*filter
:ufw-user-forward - [0:0]
:ufw-docker-logging-deny - [0:0]
:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]
-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward

-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8
-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12
-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16

-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN

-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16
-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8
-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12
-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 192.168.0.0/16
-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 10.0.0.0/8
-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 172.16.0.0/12

-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN

-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 10 -j LOG --log-prefix "[UFW DOCKER BLOCK] "
-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -j DROP

COMMIT
# END UFW AND DOCKER
```

After saving the modifications restart the server to have the changes take effect.

```bash
sudo reboot
```


## Step 3.3 - (Using ufw to open ports)
When you want to publish a port from your containers use the following command:

> This command publishes port 80 from any container's local port. Replace 80 with your custom ports for tcp communication. To use the UDP Protocol replace ``proto tcp`` with ``proto udp``.

```bash
ufw route allow proto tcp from any to any port 80
```

When you have multiple containers using the same port you can specify the container by its private (internal) ip:

```bash
ufw route allow proto tcp from any to 172.17.0.2 port 80
```

> **Please Note:** the port used at the end of this commands is the **internal** port of the container! You dont need to expose them to the host.

## Step 3.4 - (Using the ufw-docker tool for easier setup)
Instead of doing the above manual steps to install / configure ufw you could use an handy script provided by the authors of [ufw-docker Repository](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker).

To install the tool run the following command:

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker \
  https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker
```

To automatically apply the ufw ``after.rules`` change run:
```bash
sudo ufw-docker install
```

To publish a containers port use the command:
```bash
sudo ufw-docker allow <CONTAINER_NAME> <PORT>
```

Further information and help can be shown by using:
```bash
sudo ufw-docker help
```

# Step 4 - (Add your user to docker group to use Docker without sudo) (Optional)
If you wish to use docker with your regular user without using ``sudo`` all the time you can add your user to the docker group.
**Please bear in mind that users could exploit docker to gain root access to your host machine!**

To add your user to docker group run:
```bash
# Create the docker group in case it not yet exist
sudo groupadd docker
# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

You need to log out and log back in to have the changes take effect.


# Step 5 - (Install docker-compose) (Optional)
When using apps / services that depend on multiple containers / images you could use ``docker-compose`` for easier setup / maintenance. This part is based on the [offical documentation for docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
To install docker-compose run the following commands:
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

# Step 6 - (Install Portainer) (Optional)
Portainer is a Software for managing docker containers with an handy web-ui.
Additional Information can be found on the [offical documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/v/ce-2.9/start/install/server/docker/linux).

Portainer itself gets shipped as an docker image. To install simply create a new volume and run the container.
```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
docker run -d -p 9443:9443 --name portainer \
    --restart=always \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v portainer_data:/data \
    portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```

When using the ufw modification you need to add port 9443 to make it reachable:
```bash
sudo ufw-docker allow portainer 9443
```

You can now reach portainer via your webbrowser by opening url: ``https://YOURSERVER:9443``. 

> **Note:** By default portainer is using a self-signed certificate. So there might be a warning appearing when you open the web panel for the first time.

# Conclusion
The installation of docker is just the base for a lot of different applications and use-cases. You could for example install mailcow-dockerized or other software utilizing it.
By using nginx as a reverse proxy inside docker or on your host machine you could have multiple webservices listen on the same port with different domain names / paths.

# Introduction
This tutorial will show you, how you can install the Pufferpanel on a Debian or Ubuntu Server on the server "RS 2000" trough apt and how you can set up a apache2 reverse proxy to it <br>
The Pufferpanel is a simple Webpanel for game servers and many more! <br>
I am doing this on a debian 11 server, but it also should work on other debian versions and on ubuntu <br>
This Tutorial is based on the Pufferpanel Docs https://docs.pufferpanel.com/en/2.x/installing.html

# Requirements
You need a Debian or Ubuntu Server with an Internet Connection, which is accessible from the internet over a static IP on port 8080 and 5657. <br>
You also need root permissions on your server. <br>
If you want to use https, you need to have installed apache and certbot see: https://github.com/2020Sanoj/community-tutorials/blob/web/community-tutorials/apache/01-en.md

# Step 1 - Installing the Panel
First you need to connect to your server over ssh.
Then we are going to switch to the root user and are going to update the system, and then we are going to install the Pufferpanel
```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install wget curl sudo nano screen cron -y
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/pufferpanel/pufferpanel/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install pufferpanel -y
curl -L -o /etc/pufferpanel/start.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2020Sanoj/community-tutorials/pufferpanel/community-tutorials/pufferpanel/configs/start.sh
chmod +x /etc/pufferpanel/start.sh
{ crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot sleep 10 && cd /etc/pufferpanel/ && ./start.sh" ; } | crontab -
```

# Step 1.1 - Adding a User & starting the panel
Now we to add a user. <br>
```sh
pufferpanel user add
```
```
First enter a Username
Now enter your email address
Next enter a secure password and confirm it again
Select y to make the user a admin user
```
Now you can start the panel the first time
```sh
/etc/pufferpanel/start.sh
```
Now you can reach the panel over http://your-ip:8080

## Step 1.2 - Apache2 - (Optional)
First create a subdomain, which is located to your server and name it pp.example.com (replace example.com with your domain
Create an SSL Certificate (Replace example.com with your domain):
```
certbot certonly --apache -d pp.example.com
```
Download the apache2 configuration:
```sh
curl -L -o /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/pp.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2020Sanoj/community-tutorials/pufferpanel/community-tutorials/pufferpanel/configs/pp.conf
```
```sh
Now edit this configuration you just downloaded and replace every `example.com` with your domain
nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/pp.conf
```
Save your edit with ctrl + x, then press y and now save it with enter
Now restart apache
```sh
service apache2 restart
```
You now should be able to open your Pufferpanel with https://pp.example.com/

# Step 2 - Creating the first server
Login to your Pufferpanel with your email address and your password over http://your-ip:8080 or https://pp.example.com/ <br>
Now go to `Templates` and import the templates you want or download some templates from https://github.com/SanCraftDev/PufferPanel-templates/blob/main/README.md <br>
Now go to `Servers` press `+` and select the template you want, now follow the steps, at the end select install in the upper left and after that you can start your server! <br>
Under Admin you can select that your server starts on boot!

# Conclusion
Now you have installed the pufferpanel, have set up a reverse proxy to it in apache2 and created your first server!

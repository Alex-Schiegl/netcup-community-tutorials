# Introduction
This tutorial will show you, how you can install Pufferpanel on a Debian or Ubuntu server on the server "RS 2000" through apt and how you can set up a apache2 reverse proxy to it.<br>
Pufferpanel is a simple webpanel for game servers and much more!<br>
I am doing this on a Debian 11 server, but it also should work on other Debian versions and on Ubuntu<br>
This tutorial is based on the Pufferpanel docs https://docs.pufferpanel.com/en/2.x/installing.html, on https://github.com/SanCraftDev/Debian-Setup/blob/main/README.md#Snapd and on https://github.com/SanCraftDev/Debian-Setup/blob/main/README.md#Apache-and-Certbot

# Requirements
You need a Debian or Ubuntu server with an internet connection, which is accessible from the internet over a static IP on port 8080 and 5657.<br>
You also need root permissions on your server.<br>
If you want to use https and a domain or subdomain, you need also to have the server open to the internet on port 80 and 443

# Step 1 - Installing the panel
First you need to connect to your server over SSH.<br>
Then we switch to the root user and update our system, followed by installing Pufferpanel.
```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install wget curl sudo nano screen cron -y
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/pufferpanel/pufferpanel/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install pufferpanel -y
```
Now create a start file:
```sh
nano /etc/pufferpanel/start.sh
```
Now paste here:
```
screen -AmdS pp /usr/sbin/pufferpanel run
```
Save your edit with <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>, then press <kbd>y</kbd> and now save it with <kbd>ENTER</kbd><br>
Now run this script to start pufferpanel.
```sh
chmod +x /etc/pufferpanel/start.sh
```
and if you want it to run on boot:
```sh
{ crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot sleep 10 && cd /etc/pufferpanel/ && ./start.sh" ; } | crontab -
```

# Step 1.1 - Adding an user & starting the panel
Now we add an Pufferpanel-user. <br>
```sh
pufferpanel user add
```
```
First enter a username
Now enter your email address
Next enter a secure password and confirm it again
Select y to make the user a admin user
```
Now you can start the panel for the first time
```sh
/etc/pufferpanel/start.sh
```
Now you can reach the panel over http://your-ip:8080

# Step 2 - Apache2 - (Optional)

## Step 2.1 - Installing Snapd and Certbot - you can skip this step if you have already certbot installed and running
First we need to install Snapd and Certbot to get SSL certificates
```sh
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install snapd -y
snap install core; snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
{ crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "$(( $RANDOM % 60 )) $(( $RANDOM % 3 + 3 )) * * * sudo certbot renew --dry-run" ; } | crontab -
```

## Step 2.2 - Installing Apache2 - you can skip this step if you have already apache installed and running
Now we are going to install apache2
```sh
apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-php -y
```
Now we are going to configure apache2
```sh
a2enmod rewrite
a2enmod headers
a2enmod env
a2enmod dir
a2enmod mime
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod proxy_http
a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
a2enmod headers
a2enmod ssl
```
```sh
nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```
Now search with <kbd>CTRL + W</kbd> for `<Directory /var/www/>`<br>
Now go some lines down to `AllowOverride None` and replace it with `AllowOverride All` <br>
```diff
- AllowOverride None
+ AllowOverride All
```

Save your edit with <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>, then press <kbd>y</kbd> and now save it with <kbd>ENTER</kbd> and restart apache
```sh
service apache2 restart
```
## Step 2.3 Installing the configuration for Pufferpanel
First create a subdomain or domain, which is linked to your server <br>
Now create an SSL certificate (Replace DOMAIN with your domain or subdomain):
```sh
certbot certonly --apache -d DOMAIN
```
Create the Apache2 configuration:
```sh
nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/pp.conf
```
Now paste here:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName DOMAIN
    Redirect permanent / https://DOMAIN/
	Protocols h2 h2c http/1.1
    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/pp.error.log
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName DOMAIN

        ProxyPreserveHost On
        SSLProxyEngine On
        ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
        RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
        RewriteRule .* ws://localhost:8080%{REQUEST_URI} [P]

	Protocols h2 h2c http/1.1
    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/pp.error.log
SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/fullchain.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/privkey.pem
</VirtualHost>
```
Now edit this configuration and replace every `DOMAIN` with your domain or subdomain <br>
Save your edit with <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>, then press <kbd>y</kbd> and now save it with <kbd>ENTER</kbd><br>
Now restart Apache2
```sh
service apache2 restart
```
You should now be able to open Pufferpanel with https://DOMAIN/<br>
If you are doing this direct on a domain and NOT on a subdomain, I recommend to repeat this step with www.DOMAIN

# Step 3 - Creating the first server
There are some pictures below <br>
Login to your Pufferpanel with your email address and your password over http://your-ip:8080 or https://DOMAIN/ <br>
Switch to `Templates` and import the templates you want or download some templates from https://github.com/SanCraftDev/PufferPanel-templates/blob/main/README.md <br>
Now go to `Servers` press `+` and select the template you want, now follow the steps, at the end select install in the upper left and after that you can start your server! <br>
Under `Admin` you can select that your server starts on boot! <br>
Do not forget to open the correct port of the server, which you created in Pufferpanel, if it requires also an open port (for example, a Minecraft server/proxy requires port 25565)

# Conclusion
Now you have installed Pufferpanel, maybe set up a reverse proxy for Pufferpanel in Apache2 and created your first server! <br>

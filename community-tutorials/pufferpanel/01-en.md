# Introduction
This tutorial will show you, how you can install the Pufferpanel on a Debian or Ubuntu Server on the server "RS 2000" trough apt and how you can set up a apache2 reverse proxy to it <br>
Pufferpanel is a simple Webpanel for game servers and many more! <br>
I am doing this on a debian 11 server, but it also should work on other debian versions and on ubuntu <br>
This Tutorial is based on the Pufferpanel Docs https://docs.pufferpanel.com/en/2.x/installing.html

# Requirements
You need a Debian or Ubuntu Server with an Internet Connection, which is accessible from the internet over a static IP on port 80, 443 and 5657. <br>
You also need root permissions on your server. <br>
And you need to have installed apache and certbot see: 

# Step 1 - Installing the Panel
First you need to connect to your server over ssh.
Then we are going to switch to the root user and are going to update the system, and then we are going to install the Pufferpanel
```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install wget curl sudo nano screen cron -y
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/pufferpanel/pufferpanel/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install pufferpanel -y
curl -L -o /etc/pufferpanel/start.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2020Sanoj/community-tutorials/pufferpanel/community-tutorials/pufferpanel/configs/start.sh
chmod +x /etc/pufferpanel/start.sh
{ crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot sleep 10 && cd /etc/pufferpanel/ && ./start.sh" ; } | crontab -
/etc/pufferpanel/start.sh
```

# Step 1.1 - Adding a User
Now we to add a user. <br>
```
If you are getting asked for your IP address, select your right IP address, now press Enter
Or if it is saying that your server is behind a NAT, enter your static IP address, now press Enter
Now set a port of your choice and press Enter
Now give your first VPN Client a Name and press Enter
As DNS Server I recommend to use AdGuard, if you want select 6 or another DNS server, now press Enter
Start the Installation, trough pressing Enter, now wait
```
Save the Installer for later to create more client configurations
```sh
wget git.io/wireguard -O wireguard-install.sh
chmod 700 /root/wireguard-install.sh
```

## Step 1.2 - Creating/Removing client configurations or remove wireguard - (Optional)
Now, if you want to use more than one device, you should create more client configurations.
Just run:
```sh
/root/wireguard-install.sh
```
Now you can follow the steps to creat or to remov a client configurations or remove entire wireguard

# Step 2 - Setting up the devices
Download your client configuration, which is saved under /root/CLIENT-NAME.conf
Download the correct client for your device from https://www.wireguard.com/install/
Import your client configuration and connect to the VPN!

# Conclusion
Now you have set up a Wireguard VPN Server and connect your devices with the VPN. <br>

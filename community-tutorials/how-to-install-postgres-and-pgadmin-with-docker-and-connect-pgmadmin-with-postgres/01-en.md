# Introduction
This tutotiral is about how to install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin with docker and connect pgAdmin with PostgreSQL.

# Requirements
This tutorial requires the setup of docker and docker-compose. On the netcup-community-tutorials you find another tutorial how to setup docker and docker-compose.

# Step 1 - First check your docker and docker-compose version
```
docker -v
```
Output is for exmaple: Docker version 20.10.10, build b485636

```
docker-compose version
```
Output is for exmaple: Docker Compose version v2.1.0

# Step 4 - Create a compose.yaml file, with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin
Create the file compose.yaml file with nano: ```nano ./compose.yaml```

```
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:14.0
    container_name: db
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    volumes:
      - db_volume:/var/lib/postgresql
    networks:
      backend_network:
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:6.1
    container_name: pgadmin
    restart: always
    environment:
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@your-netcup-domain.net
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=secret
      - PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT=8080
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - pgadmin_volume:/var/lib/pgadmin
    networks:
      backend_network:
volumes:
  db_volume:
  pgadmin_volume:

networks:
  backend_network:
```

In the environments-definition you can see the credentials of the postgres and pgadmin.
We expose the postgres to the outside on port 5432.
pgadmin will be exposed at port 8080 to the outside.
Both services have a fix containername and both have its own volume.
Both services are using the same docker network "backend_network", which is also defined in the networks-definition.


# Step 5 - Start all docker service
To start all docker services run ```docker-compose up -d```
With the Parameter -d you start all services in detach-mode.

# Step 6 - Check status of docker containers
Check the status of the docker containers with the command: ```docker ps -a```
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                     PORTS                                                        NAMES
5b9a82c2d403   postgres:14.0                     "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes               0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp                    db
37c02d5fb68c   dpage/pgadmin4:6.1                "/entrypoint.sh"         2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes               80/tcp, 443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, :::8080->8080/tcp   pgadmin
```

In this case the status is "Up 2 minutes". It looks good.

# Step 7 - Check logs of the containers
First check the logs of the postres database container: ```docker logs db```

The log should look like:
```
2021-11-07 21:21:06.225 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on IPv4 address "0.0.0.0", port 5432
2021-11-07 21:21:06.225 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on IPv6 address "::", port 5432
2021-11-07 21:21:06.230 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on Unix socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"
2021-11-07 21:21:06.236 UTC [62] LOG:  database system was shut down at 2021-11-07 21:21:06 UTC
2021-11-07 21:21:06.243 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
```

Then check the logs of the pgadmin container: ```docker logs pgadmin```
The log should look like:
```
[2021-11-07 21:21:35 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.1.0
[2021-11-07 21:21:35 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://[::]:8080 (1)
[2021-11-07 21:21:35 +0000] [1] [INFO] Using worker: gthread
[2021-11-07 21:21:35 +0000] [88] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 88
```

# Step 8 - Open pgadmin in your browser
Open the url ```http://localhost:8080/``` in the browser.
Login with the credentials:
Username: admin@your-netcup-domain.net
Password: secret

After the login you see on the left side a "Servers" entry. Right click on "Servers", then you see a dropdown. In the dropdown click on the "Create > Server" entry. Enter the values:
Name: postgres
Then click on the next tab: Connection and enter the value:
Hostname/address: db
Port: 5432
Username: postgres
Password: postgres

Now click on Save to create the server connection from the ui to the database.
On the leftside you see one entry postgres in the servers list.
The server connection will open automatically and you see on the first page live-statistics of the running postgres database. For example server sessions. If you click on the left side on "postgres > Databases (1) > postgres > Schemas > public" you can see the default schema "public", which will be automatically created, on the first setup.

# Step 9 - Stop and remove all services
If you dont need the database and pgadmin anymore, you can stop and remove the two services with one command.
Run ```docker-compose down``` in the command-line.

# Conclusion
You learned how to install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin with docker and connect pgAdmin with PostgreSQL.
PgAdmin makes it easy to administrate the database with a webbased ui. You only need a browser for administration. For local development thats quiet helpful.

# Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up your own Node.JS web server. For this we use Netcup's hosting package: [EiWoMiSau](https://www.netcup.eu/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2042).

# Requirements

- Netcup hosting package: [EiWoMiSau](https://www.netcup.eu/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2042)
- An own domain already linked to the hosting package incl. [set up SSL certificate](https://helpcenter.netcup.com/en/wiki/web-hosting/enabling-ssl-tls) _(in our example `pentagame-online.de`)_

# Step 1 - Prepare: Host name

In order to be able to use the domain `pentagame-online.de` for various purposes, we first set up the following subdomain: `nodejs-tutorial.pentagame-online.de`.

To do this, we open the Plesk overview of our hosting package and press the [Add Subdomain] button in the dialog for [Websites & Domains].

![Add Subdomain Button](./images_en/01-website-domains-add-subdomain-button.png)

After we have defined `nodejs-tutorial` and `pentagame-online.de` for the name of the subdomain, we make sure, under document root that it matches the subdomain exactly with `/nodejs-tutorial.pentagame-online.de/drop.me`.

**Attention:** 
- In addition, the subdirectory `drop.me` refers to the location where Netcup will store the default welcome page, which we **must delete later**.  

- This setting can **only be defined once here**.

![Add Subdomain](./images_en/02-website-domains-add-subdomain-name.png)

Below we are redirected to the Plesk overview of our new subdomain.

# Step 2 - Prepare: SSL Certificate

Then we continue by clicking on [SSL/TLS Certificates].

![SSL Certificate Button](./images_en/03-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-ssl-cert-button.png)

In the following, I assume that a [Let's Encrypt certificate has already been set up for the domain `pentagame-online.de` as described here.](https://helpcenter.netcup.com/en/wiki/web-hosting/enabling-ssl-tls)

Therefore, continue immediately with [Manage].

![Manage SSL Certificate Button](./images_en/04-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-ssl-cert-manage-button.png)

Here we can save our certificate **temporarily** in *.pem format locally using the download button on the right-hand side.

![Download SSL Certificate Button](./images_en/05-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-ssl-cert-download-button.png)

And then make it available for the subdomain with [Upload .pem file].

![Upload SSL Certificate Button](./images_en/06-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-ssl-cert-upload-button.png)

With the set certificate, incoming requests can now also be successfully [Redirect(ed) from http to https]. And by clicking on the domain name, we can quickly return to the overview.

![Redirect HTTPS](./images_en/07-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-ssl-cert-redirect-https.png)

# Step 3 - Set up: Node.JS
Here we add with [Create Site] ...

![Create Website Button](./images_en/08-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-create-website-button.png)

... [Node.JS] to our website.

![Add Node.JS](./images_en/09-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-create-website-nodejs-button.png)

In order to receive more helpful debugger messages later in the event of runtime errors, we set the application mode to [development] and then click on [Enable Node.js].

![Activate Node.JS](./images_en/10-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-activate-button.png)

# Step 4 - Troubleshooting
### Error: app.js not found

The error message that now appears was actually the same in [production] mode. ;-) Regardless of this, it tells us that now is the time to create a Node.JS app first.

And for this we open the [File Manager].

![No App.js File Browser Button](./images_en/11-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-no-appjs-file-browser-button.png)

Then we navigate to the parent directory of `drop.me`.

![File Browser goto Document Root](./images_en/12-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-file-browser-goto-document-root.png)

And create the new file `app.js` there.

![Create New File](./images_en/13-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-no-appjs-create-file.png)
![Create App.js](./images_en/14-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-create-file-appjs.png)

We open the code editor for the newly created `app.js` file.

![Edit App.js](./images_en/15-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-edit-file-appjs.png)

And enter the following example source code.
```js
const http = require('http');

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  response.end("Hello, World!\n");
}).listen(port);

console.log(`App is running... (port: ${port})`);
```

In terms of content, we create an HTTP web server that responds to all browser requests on port `3000` with status code `200` (OK) and the message: `Hello, World!` of mime type: `text/plain`. However, the port can be freely selected, as it will later be used automatically by NGINX for forwarding HTTP/HTTPS requests.  

![Paste App.js Code](./images_en/16-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-paste-sample-code-appjs.png)

Back in the Node.js settings for our subdomain, we try out the "Application URL" with one click.

![Open URL](./images_en/17-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-open-url.png)

### Error: "Hier (still) entsteht eine neue Webseite"

But the default welcome page of our hosting package appears.

![Default Site](./images_en/18-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-apache-default-site.png)

This is because the primary NGINX server still passes **all** requests to the Apache web server (which can also interpret PHP). So next we disconnect the two.

To do this, we go back to [Websites & Domains] and to our subdomain `nodejs-tutorial.pentagame-online.de`, where we click on the [Hosting & DNS] tab.

![Hosting and DNS Tab](./images_en/19-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-hosting-dns-tab.png)

Then we call up the setup for [Apache & nginx],

![Apache and nginx Button](./images_en/20-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-hosting-dns-apache-nginx-button.png)

... scroll down to nginx settings,

![Apache and nginx Part 1](./images_en/21-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-apache-nginx-part-1.png)

and deactivate the [Proxy mode].

![Apache and nginx Part 2](./images_en/22-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-apache-nginx-no-proxy-part-2.png)

Back in the [Dashboard] tab, we open the file manager with [Files].

![Dashboard open Files](./images_en/23-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-file-browser-button.png)

Then we navigate again to the document root directory of our subdomain. And remove the folder `drop.me` from it, as mentioned at the beginning.

![Delete drop.me](./images_en/24-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-file-browser-delete-drop-me.png)

Back in the Plesk overview of our subdomain, we can once again see the result of the Node.JS app [Open in web].

![Reopen URL in Browser](./images_en/25-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-test-website.png)

You are probably still seeing the standard welcome page, just like me. But a reload in the browser...

![Refresh Default Site](./images_en/26-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-apache-default-site-refresh.png)

... then delivers as expected:

![Hello World](./images_en/27-nodejs-tutorial-subdomain-nodejs-hello-world.png)

# Conclusion

Great! You have now successfully made your subdomain fit for the use of your own Node.JS web server.

It's best to test the server's limits, which are still quite narrow at the moment, and
- extend it via package management, e.g. with the [Express Server Framework for Node.JS](https://expressjs.com/en)
- and/or add a MySQL database connection
- or use the Git repository feature of Plesk

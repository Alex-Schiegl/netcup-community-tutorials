# Introduction
This tutorial shows you how to setup your server to send an email when someone starts an SSH session as when logging in on your server. Please note that this is not a security method but a last failsafe and for information only.
We will use sSMTP so the server works as a mail client on an existing email address. Therefore, we don’t need to run a mail server ourselves but can use Netcups mail server

# Requirements
You will need a VPS or ROOT server of any kind with root access. All machines from Netcup will handle the task with ease. A mail account to send mails from; works great with a netcup webhosting account for example [Webhosting Bestprice Classic](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2058)  
This tutorial has been tested with the last Ubuntu (20.10) and Debian (11).

# Step 1 - Ordering the SERVER
At the time of the creation of this tutorial (January 2022), the recommended product to be used is [RS 1000 G9]( https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2619) or bigger.  
Existing customers can add the product easily and quickly.

# Step 2 - Basic configuration of the server
Ensure that the server is up to date and upgrade the system:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
```
Install the required package ssmtp:
```
sudo apt install ssmtp -y
```
# Step 3 - Configuration of sSMTP daemon
In this step we will configure sSMTP to use a mail account to send mails from. Please create a new email address for this purpose. You will need the following data:

- Username for the new created email address
- Password for the new created email address
- SMTP server for the new created email address
- SMTP Port, should be 25.

Create configuration file for sSMTP

```
sudo nano  /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
```

add the following lines but update the login information to work with your newly created mail account.

```
#/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
root=server@YourDomainFromNetcup.com
mailhub= mx2f11.netcup.net:25
rewriteDomain=YourDomainFromNetcup.com
AuthUser=YourDomainFromNetcup.com 
AuthPass=YourPasswordForTheMailAccount
FromLineOverride=YES
```

This will enbale sSMTP to send mails from your email account. It is recommended to create a mail account for this purpose only! Don’t use your daily account!

# Step 4 – create a mail template
The server is now able to send mails. To do that on a login, we must create a mail template.
We could just send a simple alert, but it is nice to get more information to identify a possible thread.
Therefore we will send a mail that contains the username of the user, the IP, date and time of the login. 

Create a file for that purpose.
`sudo nano /srv/mailatlogin.sh`

Copy and paste this content to your file
```
#!/bin/sh
date=$(date '+%d.%m.%Y')
host=$(hostname)
ip=$(hostname -I)
{
echo To: Reciever@yourDomain.com
echo From: SERVER YourDomainFromNetcup.com
echo Subject: "SERVER LOGIN! from $PAM_USER on $host IP: $PAM_RHOST $date"
echo
echo "Login detected on the server $HOSTNAME from 
IP: $ip 
User: $PAM_USER
If this is not you, act immediately!"
} | ssmtp Receiver@yourDomain.com
```

Save and exit the editor.  

Make the script executeable with the command
```
sudo chmod +x /srv/mailatlogin.sh
```
The first lines reads the information from your system and stores them into variables for later use. We get the date, hostname and ip address. Then we will add this information to your mail.  
All content between the curly braces is the mail.  
`Echo To` and `Echo From` must be supplemented with your data.  
`Echo Subject` is the subject of your mail. It can be edited if needed. All values starting with `$` are variables. There will automatically be replaced with the corresponding value.  
The next echo is the content of the mail and can be edited or replaced.  
Please be aware of the last line! Here you need to replace Receiver@yourDomain.com with your mailadress!
# Step 5. Testing
Test the script with the command
```
sudo /srv/mailatlogin.sh
```
And check your mail address. You should have gotten a new mail.
# Step 6. Add the script to your sshd configuration
Open the sshd.config with 
```
nano /etc/pam.d/sshd
```
and add the following line on the end
```
session optional pam_exec.so /srv/mailatlogin.sh
```
Save and close the file.
Restart the ssh deamdon with
```
systemctl restart ssh
```

# Step 7. Relog
Log our from your system with
`exit`
and login again.
Check your mails! You should have gotten a new mail.

# Step 8. errors you may detect
- Check syslog for errors
```
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```
- Check the script for errors. 
- Check the SPAM folder of your inbox
- Check the sSMTP config /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

Use this command to send a small test mail from the command line
```
{
echo To: Reciever@yourDomain.com
echo From: SERVER YourDomainFromNetcup.com
echo Subject: “Connection TEST” 
echo "TEST MAIL"
} | ssmtp Receiver@yourDomain.com
```
Replace Receiver@yourDomain.com with your mailadress.

# Conclusion
Your server will now send you alert mails when someone is logging in. As mentioned before this will not enhance the security of your server but only informs you that something is wrong and that you need to react immediately if its not you who logged on.
Please be aware that the script will react to all SSH sessions started this means also scp, rsync and so on.

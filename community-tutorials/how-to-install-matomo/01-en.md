# Introduction

# Step 1 - Setup of a new Subdomain

If you dont want to use a subdomain, you can skip this step.

1. Log in to the CCP (CustomerControlPanel) under https://www.customercontrolpanel.de.
2. On the Left side, click on "Products".
3. If you have multiple products, select the one you want to use by clicking on the magnifying glass symbol next to it.
4. Because you will need this value later, copy the value of the "MySQL-Server:" field (e.g. `mysqlexyz.netcup.net`).
5. In the new window, on the bottom, click on "Plesk Overview".
6. In the new browser tab, click on "Add Subdomain".
7. In the Input field, enter your subdomain name (e.g. `matomo`).
8. In the Dropdown menu, select the domain you want to use.
9. Click on "OK".

# Step 2 - Creating the Database

1. Click on "Databases" on the left side.
2. Click on "Add Database".

7. Click on the "Show" button next to the input field for "Database user password" to show the password and then copy it.
8. Click on "OK".

# Step 3 - Getting a SSL Certificate

1. Under "Security" click on "SSL/TLS Certificates".
2. Click on the "Install"-Button.
3. Enter your email address.
4. Check the last checkbox.
5. Click on "Get it free".
6. On the left side, toggle the Switch with "Redirect from http to https" to "On".
7. On the left side, toggle the Switch with "OCSP Stapling" to "On".

# Step 4 - Downloading Matomo

1. In the Plesk-Sidemenu on the left side, click on "Files".
2. Click on the folder named after your subdomain (e.g. `matomo.example.com`) and then on `httpdocs`.
3. Click on `+` and then on `Import file via URL`.
4. Copy the following URL and paste it into the input field: `https://builds.matomo.org/matomo-latest.zip`.
5. Click on `Import`.
6. If you can't see the file `matomo-latest.zip` in the folder, reload the page.

# Step 5 - Extracting Matomo

1. Click on `matomo-latest.zip`
2. Click on `OK`.
3. Select all checkboxes that are not for the `matomo`-Folder.
4. Click on `Remove` in the menu on the top.
5. Open the `matomo`-Folder by clicking on it.
6. Click the topmost checkbox to select all files and folders. (In the table header, next to the `Name`-Column)
7. Click on `Move` in the menu on the top.
8. Double click on the Folder named after your subdomain (e.g. `matomo.example.com`).
9. Click on the `httpdocs`-Folder.
10. Click on `OK`.

# Step 6 - Installing Matomo

1. Open your browser and go to your subdomain (e.g. `https://matomo.example.com`).
2. Click on `Next`.
3. Everything should be green. If not, fix the issues - Matomo will tell you how.
4. Click on `Next`.
5. Enter your database credentials (database name, database user name, database user password) from step 1.4 and 2 (Warning: The username and database name have a prefix which is your user-id followed by an underscore, e.g. `k123456_matomo`).
6. You can leave the "Table Prefix" setting as it is.
7. Change the "Adapter" setting to `MYSQLI` (This is because the current version has shown some issues with the `PDO`-Adapter whilst testing).
8. Click on `Next`.
9. Click on `Next`.
10. Enter credentials for a new superuser account - This will be the account you will use to log in to Matomo as an administrator.
11. Click on `Next`.

# Step 7 - Finishing the Installation

1. Enter a Identifier for your website (e.g. `My Homepage`).
2. Enter the domain of the website you want to track (e.g. `example.com`).
3. Set the timezone to your timezone.
4. If your website is a Ecommerce-Website, toggle the respective switch to `On`.
5. Click on `Next`.
6. Now you can copy the tracking code and paste it into your website.
7. Click on `Next`.
8. Click on `Continue to Matomo`.

# Conclusion

Now you have successfully installed Matomo on your server.

From now on it will be available under your subdomain (e.g. `https://matomo.example.com`).

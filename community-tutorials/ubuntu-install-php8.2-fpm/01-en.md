# Introduction
This tutorial describes how to Install Apache2 with php8.2-fpm on a Ubuntu Server.
The tutorial is only testet on Ubuntu 22.04, but should also work on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04.

# Requirements

* Server (root or vps) with Ubuntu Server 22.04

# Step 1 - Check for System updates
Check your System for updates and install them before.
```
apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```
# Step 2 - Install Apache2
```
apt-get install apache2
```

# Step 3 - Install PHP8.2-FPM
Because PHP8.2 is not yet included in the Ubuntu repository, we need to add the PPA repository
```
add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```
Then update package sources.
```
apt-get update
```
Install PHP8.2 with commonly used modules (bz2,curl,mbstring,intl,bcmath,xml,mysql,zip,gd,mbstring,imagick). Here you can add modules or remove some.
```
apt-get install php8.2-{fpm,cli,bz2,curl,mbstring,intl,bcmath,xml,mysql,zip,gd,mbstring,imagick}
```
Enable the config of Apache2 php8.2-fpm.\
In the config the mods proxy_fcgi and setenvif are used, so enable them too.
```
a2enmod proxy_fcgi setenvif
a2enconf php8.2-fpm 

```
Restart apache
```
systemctl reload apache2
```
Check the installation 
```
nano /var/www/html/test.php
```
Add following:
```
<?php
    phpinfo();
?>
```
Use a Browser and go to http://ip_of_your_server/test.php \
Server API Should be FPM/FastCGI.

Now you have succesfully installed Apache2 with php8.2-fpm.
The Path of the php.ini is /etc/php/8.2/fpm/php.ini \
If you need, we can increase memory-limit and maximum of upload filesize. (Other values can changed too)
```
nano /etc/php/8.2/fpm/php.ini
```
```diff
- memory_limit = 128M
+ memory_limit = 256M
- upload_max_filesize = 2M
+ upload_max_filesize = 16M
- post_max_size = 8M
+ post_max_size = 16M
```
Restart php-fpm.
```
/etc/init.d/php8.2-fpm restart
```
Then verify the values with the test.php Script.

# Step 4 - (Optional) Add a new V-Host
The Server is only Listening by IP. If you have a Domain we can add a new V-Host.
```
mkdir /var/www/vhostname
nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/vhostname.conf
```
Insert the following content and replace vhost and yourdomain.de with your names.
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName www.yourdomain.de
        ServerAlias yourdomain.de #Optional Alias the Server is listen too
        ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.de
        DocumentRoot /var/www/vhostname

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/vhostname_error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/vhostname_access.log combined

        <Directory "/var/www/vhostname">
            AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
Enable V-Host and restart Apache
```
a2ensite vhostname
systemctl reload apache2
```

# Step 4.1 - (Optional) Install SSL Certificate from Let's Encrypt
Install Certbot
```
apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-apache
```
Generate and install SSL-Certificate
```
certbot --apache -d yourDomain.de,www.yourAlais.de
```
# Step 5 - (Optional) Enable Http/2 Protocol
Enable the apache http2 Module and restart apache
```
a2enmod http2
systemctl restart apache2
```
# Conclusion

You have installed Apache2 with PHP8.2-FPM. Optional SSL installed with http/2 Protocol.\
If you have multiple Domains you can repeat step 4 to add more domains.
The server is not yet secured and should still be secured. This Tutorial are only basic steps for installation of Apache2 with php8.2-fpm.
